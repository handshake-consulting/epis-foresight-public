This builds directly on the concept of smart mob swarming described in the book, where leaders must "assemble and orchestrate smart mob swarms of humans and generative agents."\n\nThese leaders will apply the strength-with-humility skill in new ways. As the book notes, "Leaders will need a very strong presence with an ability to express that presence humbly. Arrogant leaders who lead with certainty will be brittle in this emerging future." This quality becomes even more crucial when working with AI systems that may provide recommendations with high confidence but limited context awareness.\n\nThe futureback curiosity skill will evolve to include what we might call "AI discernment" - knowing when to trust machine recommendations and when human judgment should prevail. This isn't merely technical knowledge but an extension of the human calming skill that centers leaders "in human intention, discernment, and discipline."\n\nWe can see early signals of this capability in organizations experimenting with AI advisory systems that provide alternative perspectives to leadership teams. These tools don't replace human leaders but expand what IDEO might call the "prototyping process" to include organizational structures and decision-making approaches.\n\nIn the BANI world (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible), leaders will need to apply the dilemma-flipping skill to navigate the tensions between technological efficiency and human values. They'll reject simplistic either/or thinking about technology, instead developing frameworks that preserve human agency while leveraging computational power.\n\nThe commons creating skill will become essential as leaders establish shared spaces where humans and AI can productively collaborate. As noted in the book, these commons will be environments "within which both cooperation and competition may occur."\n\nLeaders who master these capabilities won't merely adapt to disruption - they'll harness it to create organizations that are more resilient and innovative, much like navigating "a wild river's tumultuous waters" with both foresight and agility.	2025-03-20 06:15:16.592638+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/89bf779d-42de-4428-958a-9386b3f817e9.jpg

The scrutiny that all leaders face intensifies for women navigating leadership roles in environments where strength with humility must be carefully calibrated.\n\nEllen Galinsky's approach offers valuable insights for women executives. As president of the Families and Work Institute, Galinsky demonstrates how to lead without self-promotion. Though energetic and outgoing, she focuses on spreading her message about work-life navigation rather than elevating her personal brand. Her appearances on programs like the Today show come because people seek her expertise—she doesn't chase recognition. This understated style allows her to become an authority while maintaining authenticity.\n\nThis approach aligns with the observation that leaders who advertise themselves become targets. Just as BP faced heightened criticism after rebranding as "Beyond Petroleum," women executives who appear self-promotional often encounter resistance. Instead, the quiet transparency Galinsky embodies—being engaged and open without overselling—creates space for substantive leadership.\n\nGenerative AI will reshape this dynamic through several mechanisms. The improved perspective-taking capabilities described in the strength with humility section can help women executives understand how their leadership style registers across different contexts. Advanced decision support systems will provide data-driven insights that complement intuitive decision-making. Automated administrative tasks will free women leaders to focus on dilemmas requiring nuanced thinking, while cultural competence enhancement tools will help calibrate communication approaches.\n\nWomen executives must particularly attend to the human calming skill as AI becomes more integrated into leadership practices. Maintaining clarity of intention and discerning choices becomes essential when navigating environments where leadership expectations may differ based on gender.\n\nThe future demands women executives who can leverage AI augmentation while preserving authentic leadership presence. This requires developing all ten leadership skills with particular attention to strength with humility—demonstrating capability without triggering the backlash that often accompanies women's displays of authority. Those who master this balance will thrive in leadership roles where pervasive computing makes transparency inevitable but where quiet confidence remains powerful.	2025-03-20 06:44:25.183386+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a812ec86-bb69-485f-b530-be871ebb591a.jpg

The iconic Rockpool Bar & Grill in Sydney, with its commitment to premium Australian ingredients and high-end dining experiences, could implement immersive learning techniques that reflect Australia's distinctive food culture and service expectations.\n\nAustralian restaurants face particular challenges with seasonal staff fluctuations due to tourism patterns and working holiday visas. Rockpool might create immersive training environments where permanent staff experience the disorientation of temporary workers by working unfamiliar stations under time pressure. This mirrors the motel cleaning exercise where executives cleaned rooms under the same 20-minute constraint as regular staff, gaining empathy for frontline workers' experiences.\n\nThe vast distances between Australian population centers also create supply chain challenges unique to the continent. Restaurant leaders could immerse themselves in the journey of their ingredients—perhaps spending time on fishing trawlers in the Great Barrier Reef or at remote cattle stations in the Northern Territory. This firsthand experience with producers would transform their understanding of ingredient quality, seasonality, and sustainability in ways that mere supplier meetings cannot.\n\nAustralian restaurants could also leverage immersive technologies to prepare for the country's extreme climate events. Virtual simulations could help staff practice emergency protocols for bushfires or cyclones, creating what Jane McGonigal would call "urgent optimism" about their ability to handle crises while maintaining guest safety and service standards.\n\nThe WorldBoard concept could be particularly powerful in Australian restaurants, where digital overlays might show kitchen staff the cultural significance of native ingredients to Aboriginal communities. This would create deeper connections to Australia's food heritage while enhancing the stories staff can share with guests about the menu.\n\nRockpool and similar establishments could participate in industry-wide commons for basic food safety while developing distinctive immersive learning for uniquely Australian service challenges—like helping international visitors navigate unfamiliar native ingredients or managing outdoor dining during sudden weather changes.\n\nBy creating these low-risk environments to practice high-stakes interactions, Australian restaurants would prepare staff for the unexpected challenges of service before they impact guest experiences—embodying Jake Dunagan's wisdom about being "surprised by simulation rather than blindsided by reality" in a distinctly Australian context.	2025-04-07 23:54:22.217293+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e8ce6330-3ccc-4c9c-b529-dc219f1dfcab.jpg

As pervasive computing networks make measurement ubiquitous, leaders will face new accountability challenges. The certification systems developed by NGOs like Fair Trade Certified and Marine Stewardship Council will expand to monitor leadership ethics, creating digital footprints that follow leaders throughout their careers.\n\nDigital twins of leaders might present idealized versions that diverge from actual behavior. The gap between a leader's AI-enhanced public persona and their private actions will create opportunities for misrepresentation. The same technologies that Ellen Galinsky used to reframe work-life balance as "navigation" will be needed to navigate the complex ethical terrain of augmented leadership.\n\nThe BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—will amplify the appeal of leaders who offer certainty. Some will exploit this desire for simple answers by using AI tools to project strength without the necessary humility. The threshold of righteousness that Bob describes will make some leaders justify questionable actions because they believe so firmly in their own rightness.\n\nCross-cultural grace will become essential for addressing varying definitions of corruption. As Edward T. Hall noted, "We must never assume that we are fully aware of what we communicate to someone else." This awareness becomes crucial when leadership practices acceptable in one context may be considered corrupt in another.\n\nConstructive depolarization skills will help distinguish genuine corruption from partisan attacks. When accusations become weaponized in polarized environments, leaders who can create dialogue across difference will be better positioned to maintain ethical standards while acknowledging cultural variations.\n\nThe dilemma-flipping skill will be particularly valuable, as corruption is rarely a simple problem to solve but rather a complex dilemma to manage. Leaders will need to balance transparency with privacy, strength with humility, and clarity with the acknowledgment of uncertainty.\n\nHuman calming—grounding leadership in clear intention and self-discipline—will remain the foundation for ethical leadership in an augmented future.	2025-03-20 06:51:38.333758+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/5f41961d-8ffa-4415-baeb-c61f0baae3fb.jpg

As sensing, measuring, and monitoring tools become ubiquitous, leaders will face unprecedented scrutiny of their actions. The certification systems that NGOs like Fair Trade Certified and Marine Stewardship Council have pioneered for corporations will evolve to include leadership ethics certification, creating digital footprints that follow leaders throughout their careers.\n\nThe open-source thinking that drives transparency will create both opportunities and challenges for anti-corruption efforts. When measurement tools become pervasive, almost everything will be measured—but the interpretation of those measurements will remain contested territory. Leaders will need to navigate the dilemma of being transparent without being self-promotional, as Ellen Galinsky has done in her work reframing work-life balance as "navigation."\n\nConstructive depolarization skills will become essential for fighting corruption across cultural and ideological divides. As Chuck Palus and Wilfred Drath at the Center for Creative Leadership have shown, "putting something in the middle" can help establish dialogue in polarized situations. In the context of anti-corruption efforts, this might mean creating shared standards and metrics that transcend political divisions.\n\nGenerative AI will amplify leaders' ability to fight corruption by helping them track their own biases, develop real-time emotional intelligence, and enhance cultural sensitivity. These tools will help leaders distinguish between genuine corruption and cultural differences in leadership practices. The "Sisu.is" app, which translates communication across different personality types, offers a glimpse of how AI might help bridge ethical divides.\n\nIn the BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—fighting corruption will require both strength and humility. Leaders will need to be strong in their ethical commitments while remaining humble enough to recognize that definitions of corruption vary across cultures and contexts. They will need to balance transparency with discretion, certainty with openness to dialogue, and personal conviction with respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nThe most effective anti-corruption leaders will be those who can maintain their ethical standards while engaging constructively with those who see the world differently.	2025-03-20 08:57:11.287548+00	2	f	f

This shift will not follow traditional development hierarchies but will instead build on reciprocity-based innovation models.\n\nBrazil's approach to open-source software offers an instructive example. The Brazilian government began phasing out closed-source software in government work and invested in developing open-source alternatives powered by local talent. This created a technological commons that benefited Brazil's entire economy while reducing dependency on foreign technology providers.\n\nSimilar commons-creating approaches will emerge in other regions. The Honey Bee Network, which Dr. Anil Gupta established at the Indian Institute of Management, documents traditional knowledge and grassroots innovations. This network now includes 100,000 ideas from countries including India, Mongolia, Kenya, Vietnam, and Uganda. The "honey bee philosophy" enables cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration across geographical boundaries, bringing innovations to the public domain through its newsletter distributed in 75 countries.\n\nClimate-induced migrations will form new diasporas that function as natural commons with shared values and perspectives. These diasporas will initially create commons structures within their communities but will face challenges extending these commons beyond their immediate constituencies.\n\nIn 2035, many young people in these regions will be GenAI natives who approach problems with what the book describes as a "gameful mindset." These digital natives will be "superconnected and savvy about protecting their own personal data," though many will also be "asset poor." Their leadership approaches will reflect their early exposure to social media and generative AI.\n\nLeaders navigating these environments will need what the book calls "cross-cultural grace" – the ability to listen and learn from people who are very different from themselves. This skill will be essential for constructive depolarization in a world where differences are increasingly visible and engagement across boundaries is necessary for creating sustainable commons.	2025-03-20 09:00:20.845722+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ab398d60-bd02-492b-a4d4-b790e96611c7.jpg

The BANI characteristics of brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility will reshape how leadership transitions occur.\n\nTraditional leadership overthrows typically followed recognizable patterns: coups, revolutions, or electoral defeats. In contrast, future power struggles may involve distributed challenges where no single opposition leader exists to target. A government official might make a decision that triggers thousands of AI agents to analyze it from multiple angles, generate counter-narratives, and distribute them through personalized channels. These narratives coordinate specific responses tailored to local contexts, creating not a unified protest but a multifaceted response across physical and digital spaces.\n\nThis pattern extends beyond politics. In organizations, leaders who fail to engage with smart mob swarms may find their authority eroded through what might be called "network legitimacy gaps" - where formal authority remains intact while actual influence migrates to emergent networks of humans and AI agents who better address stakeholder needs.\n\nLeaders who navigate these environments successfully will need to extend their flexive intent and neuro-adaptability. They will need to maintain clarity about their direction while continuously engaging with distributed feedback. This requires developing what we might call "presence distribution" - the ability to authentically engage across multiple networks simultaneously through both human and AI representatives.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness becomes particularly dangerous in these contexts. When extreme groups gain access to powerful AI coordination tools, they can amplify certainty-based messaging that undermines constructive engagement. Leaders must practice constructive depolarization at scale, using the same technologies to create spaces for dialogue across difference.\n\nThe maker instinct will play a crucial role in these power dynamics. Just as insurgent makers adapt consumer technologies for conflict, organizational insurgents will adapt AI tools to challenge leadership. The most effective leaders will embrace this energy, creating rapid prototyping approaches to governance and decision-making that incorporate feedback from the edges of their networks.	2025-03-20 10:30:44.700379+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/8ca20a00-03d1-4c87-8bb2-c2e60fc17abe.jpg

These young leaders, who grew up in an unprecedented media ecology of social media, cloud computing, and generative AI, will bring different perspectives to leadership roles. Their leadership approaches will be shaped by their experiences as the first generation to become adults in this digital environment.\n\nThe perception that youth lack leadership capacity stems from misunderstanding their different approaches rather than any inherent deficiency. Many digital natives demonstrate a gameful mindset, greater acceptance of diversity, and deep concern about climate disruption. Their asset-poor status combined with digital connectivity creates a leadership perspective that can appear foreign to established leaders.\n\nGenAI will bridge this generational leadership gap through personalized AI coaching for both rising stars and senior leaders. Digital twins will facilitate communication across generational divides, helping each group understand the other's perspectives and strengths. This technology-enabled dialogue will create leadership teams that leverage both the digital fluency of youth and the experience of seasoned leaders.\n\nThe depolarizing skill becomes particularly relevant in this context. Leaders must redirect the energy of intergenerational conflict toward constructive engagement. This requires cross-cultural grace – the ability to listen and learn from people who are different, perhaps in disturbing ways. The threshold of righteousness, where one generation believes it has all the answers, creates barriers to effective leadership development.\n\nLeaders demonstrating strength with humility will recognize that effective leadership teams in 2035 will need to incorporate multiple generational perspectives. The most successful organizations will create leadership commons where both digital natives and experienced leaders contribute their unique strengths.\n\nBy 2035, leadership will increasingly be judged not by age but by the ability to navigate BANI conditions with clarity while avoiding the trap of certainty. The future demands leaders who can flip the generational dilemma by creating leadership approaches that incorporate diverse perspectives rather than privileging any single generational viewpoint.	2025-03-20 10:51:52.506097+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ebb9b0a2-57ea-4e2b-a970-70d68fc93308.jpg

This approach must integrate both human wisdom and machine intelligence while providing structure without rigidity.\n\nThe foundation begins with futureback curiosity, looking ahead ten years and working backward to inform present decisions. Unlike traditional planning that extrapolates from the present, futureback thinking requires leaders to immerse themselves in future possibilities before determining today's actions. This approach aligns with the Foresight-Insight-Action Cycle described in the book.\n\nFour interconnected pathways emerge for augmented leadership:\n\nThe first pathway involves continuously cycling through foresight, insight, and action. Leaders must scan for signals of change, develop insights about what these signals mean, and take concrete actions. Generative AI can process vast amounts of data to identify patterns, while humans provide contextual understanding and ethical judgment.\n\nThe second pathway focuses on deliberate cultivation of all ten leadership skills outlined in the book. Leaders should particularly emphasize skills that complement their natural strengths. A leader strong in clarity might need to develop their dilemma-flipping skill to handle complex challenges.\n\nThe third pathway centers on human-machine collaboration. Leaders must define their specific needs using the template: "I want help... in order to..." This requires self-awareness about which aspects of leadership should remain human and which can be augmented by machines, similar to Bob Johansen's examples for his writing process.\n\nThe fourth pathway establishes ethical boundaries. As leaders become increasingly augmented, they must create clear guidelines around decision accountability, data privacy, and algorithmic bias.\n\nThis approach is cyclical rather than linear, requiring leaders to revisit each pathway as conditions change. It embraces both the logical precision of algorithms and the intuitive wisdom of human experience—combining elements of both Gates and Gandalf as described in the book. Leaders who follow this approach will be better positioned to thrive in the increasingly chaotic future that Confucius warned about when he said, "If a man takes no thought of what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand."	2025-03-20 10:55:36.093977+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/bb234c32-c736-4369-89c1-1902e9c06ad3.jpg

The book's discussion of IDEO's approach to rapid prototyping illustrates this shift. At IDEO, approximately one hundred versions of the PalmPilot are displayed in their Palo Alto office, ranging from crude foam cutouts to machine-shop prototypes to the final commercial product. This visual history reveals how each "failure" contained valuable lessons that informed the next iteration.\n\nThis approach challenges traditional leadership models that emphasize avoiding failure. As described in the military context, leaders typically follow a "one-third, two-thirds" rule, where one-third of time is spent planning and two-thirds preparing in the field. However, rapid prototyping inverts this formula, suggesting leaders should minimize planning and maximize learning through action.\n\nLeaders in the BANI future will need to make promises that acknowledge uncertainty while providing direction. David Kelley of IDEO noted to Bob that futureback thinking helps prevent wasted effort on products that "never should have been built in the first place." This integration of foresight with rapid prototyping allows leaders to make more informed commitments based on emerging trends rather than false certainty.\n\nThe strength with humility skill becomes crucial in this context. As the book explains, leaders must balance "the power of clarity with the grace of self-awareness and respect for others." This means having the strength to set direction while maintaining the humility to acknowledge that the path forward will involve failures and adjustments.\n\nGenAI tools will enhance this promise-fail cycle by allowing leaders to simulate multiple scenarios without real-world costs. However, the human calming skill remains essential. While AI can help leaders understand potential consequences of failure, only humans can create the psychological safety that allows teams to take risks and learn from failures.\n\nThe IDEO workspaces themselves embody this philosophy. Their design studios feature unique elements like a gutted Volkswagen bus rebuilt as a work environment or the tailpiece from an old DC-3 aircraft. These playful environments stimulate creativity and support the rapid prototyping mindset where promising and failing are not opposites but complementary parts of the leadership journey.	2025-03-20 11:05:49.378444+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/59c1418e-f933-4e4a-b0a1-a09e3caa00b9.jpg

The "one-third, two-thirds" military planning principle offers a starting point, but augmented leadership training inverts this ratio—minimizing planning while maximizing field preparation and learn-as-you-go action.\n\nIDEO's approach to rapid prototyping provides a compelling model for leadership development. Their designers create approximately one hundred versions before finalizing products like the PalmPilot, with each failure revealing lessons for the next iteration. Similarly, aspiring leaders might create leadership "prototypes" by volunteering for increasingly complex projects, collecting feedback, and refining their approach with each experience.\n\nImmersive learning environments offer particularly rich training grounds. As IFTF futurist Jake Dunagan notes, "It is better to be surprised by a simulation than blindsided by reality." These environments need not be high-tech—the industrial cleaning products CEO who took potential leaders to client sites rather than upscale restaurants created an immersive learning experience that connected leaders directly to their market reality.\n\nGaming environments, despite their sometimes questionable reputation, develop sophisticated skills. Research by Steinkuehler and Duncan reveals that World of Warcraft players develop mathematical models and scientific thinking habits. For leadership development, games provide low-risk practice fields where, as Sian Beilock's research shows, leaders can develop routines that prevent "choking" under pressure.\n\nBy 2035, leadership development programs might incorporate personalized AI-generated simulations that adapt to a leader's specific growth edges. These programs could create scenarios where leaders practice strength with humility—a quality exemplified by Ellen Galinsky, who became an authority on work-life navigation without developing an inflated ego.\n\nThe British Petroleum case demonstrates the importance of transparent but not self-promotional leadership. BP's "Beyond Petroleum" campaign made them a target when the Gulf oil rig explosion occurred. Future leadership training will likely emphasize what the Center for Creative Leadership calls "the amazing power in vulnerability"—teaching leaders to remove protective masks while maintaining strength.\n\nUltimately, leadership development must balance technological augmentation with human calming—the grounding in intention, discernment, and self-discipline that remains uniquely human.	2025-03-20 11:16:09.939239+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/2274a49f-1dfa-4427-baf6-966ad67708ef.jpg

While the term "artificial intelligence" implies replacing humans with computers, this framing kindles more fear than hope. As Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in this field, suggests, we might better understand these tools as "an innovative form of social collaboration."\n\nThe next decade will see service designers working with what Thomas Malone at MIT calls "superminds"—humans augmented by AI working together to accomplish what neither could do alone. This isn't about prediction but about exploring multiple possible futures for how service experiences might evolve.\n\nWe can observe early signals of this shift in applications like Butterflies, which helps teams coordinate in real-time, and Elicit, which assists with research tasks. These tools point toward a future where AI agents perform increasingly complex service design tasks without requiring step-by-step instructions. A restaurant manager might say, "Review our customer feedback from the past month, identify recurring themes, and suggest three service modifications that would address the most common concerns." The AI completes this analysis while the manager focuses on implementation.\n\nService design will benefit from what Edgar Schein calls "humble inquiry"—the gentle art of asking instead of telling. When AI handles administrative burdens, service providers can dedicate more attention to asking thoughtful questions that create authentic connections with customers. Schein's approach emphasizes curiosity and openness rather than presuming to know what customers need.\n\nOne surprising development may be how AI helps re-enchant service experiences. MIT computer scientist David Rose coined the term "enchanted objects" to describe how AI allows ordinary objects to do extraordinary things. Imagine restaurant tables that subtly change lighting based on conversation patterns or menus that personalize descriptions based on a diner's previous experiences.\n\nMultiple pathways exist for how service design might evolve with AI. In one scenario, service becomes increasingly standardized as AI optimizes for efficiency. In another, AI handles routine elements while humans focus on creating unique, memorable moments. A third possibility sees AI and humans co-creating entirely new service categories we haven't yet imagined.\n\nAs Kentaro Toyama notes in his analysis of technology for social change, effective implementation requires intention (purposeful application), discernment (knowing when and how to use the technology), and self-control (maintaining human judgment). These three pillars will determine whether AI truly enhances or merely complicates service design.	2025-04-07 23:57:35.872991+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/2dd2228c-c49c-4ae7-8d6c-4ed7aca267a1.jpg

Unlike conventional planning that projects incrementally from today, this approach begins with a vision anchored ten years ahead and works backward.\n\nLeaders start by establishing future points based on signals of change visible today. A leader might focus on a future where human-agent partnerships have evolved beyond current organizational structures, or where leadership effectiveness prioritizes calm over speed—reflecting the shift from efficiency to effectiveness outlined in the present-forward versus futureback comparison.\n\nThe roadmap identifies key moments when fundamental shifts in capabilities must occur. For instance, when generative AI evolves from an efficiency tool to a partner in meaning-making, organizations must adapt their approach to remain viable.\n\nThis approach maps several possible journeys, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of our future. This preserves the "great clarity of direction but great flexibility in execution" that characterizes effective action in the Foresight-Insight-Action Cycle.\n\nThe roadmap includes areas where organizations must develop capabilities that extend beyond current practices. These might include developing skills to work in the human/agent swarms mentioned in the futureback view, or building cross-generational mentoring systems that leverage AI-amplified gaming for leadership development.\n\nFinally, the roadmap specifies immediate steps that begin the journey toward the future vision. These actions generate learning and insight, becoming part of the ongoing cycle where action feeds back into foresight. This approach helps leaders maintain the full-spectrum thinking necessary to navigate the gradients of possibility between judging too soon and deciding too late in an increasingly BANI world.	2025-03-20 11:17:58.324907+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e25da329-1acd-40fb-82d5-eaa9aab5c595.jpg

The Institute for the Future and organizations like the Center for Creative Leadership are already exploring how augmentation will reshape leadership training.\n\nFuture leaders will practice in AI-enhanced immersive environments where they can safely experiment with the ten leadership skills. These environments will allow leaders-in-training to test approaches to complex dilemmas, fail early, and learn quickly—embodying the rapid prototyping approach that IDEO has pioneered. Just as IDEO designers evolved the PalmPilot through numerous iterations, leaders will develop their capabilities through repeated cycles of experimentation.\n\nLeadership programs will need to teach what we might call "augmentation literacy"—the ability to work effectively with AI tools while maintaining human judgment. This means helping leaders develop their clarity stories that can guide AI interactions. When leaders have a strong sense of purpose and direction, they can better direct AI tools to amplify their intentions rather than substitute for them.\n\nThe human calming skill will become a cornerstone of leadership development as technology accelerates. Training programs will incorporate practices that help leaders maintain intention, discernment, and discipline—qualities that cannot be outsourced to AI. This balance will be essential as leaders navigate between digital augmentation and human-centered presence.\n\nPrograms will teach leaders to use AI for dilemma flipping, helping them see patterns in complex problems that might otherwise remain invisible. Just as IFTF and IDEO have collaborated to combine foresight with prototyping, leadership training will combine human insight with AI-enhanced pattern recognition.\n\nThe strength-with-humility skill will require deliberate cultivation. As AI systems become more capable, leadership programs will need to create experiences that humble leaders while simultaneously empowering them with new technological capabilities. This combination—being both augmented and human—will define effective leadership development as we approach 2035.	2025-03-20 11:27:48.432839+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/31e9623d-2527-4ad3-af2c-bcfd142fa755.jpg

The traditional view of leadership strength—characterized by certainty, dominance, and self-promotion—becomes problematic in environments marked by brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility. \n\nThe BP case illustrates this complexity. When BP changed its name to "Beyond Petroleum" and implemented various sustainability initiatives, the company inadvertently created expectations it couldn't meet. Rather than building credibility, this approach made BP vulnerable to criticism. When the oil rig explosion occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, BP's environmental reputation was already tenuous, and the disaster severely damaged it further. The company continues to work toward recovery from this reputational damage. This example demonstrates that leaders should practice transparency without self-promotion—doing the right thing while allowing others to recognize and validate those actions.\n\nEllen Galinsky's leadership at the Families and Work Institute demonstrates an alternative approach. While energetic and engaged in her field, Galinsky has developed authority on work-life navigation without self-promotion. Her research is widely shared, and she has become a go-to expert for media on work-life issues. Her influence stems from substantive contributions rather than self-celebration, showing how one can lead effectively without an inflated ego.\n\nResearch from the Center for Creative Leadership suggests that vulnerability enhances leadership effectiveness. Their studies indicate that leaders who maintain protective facades—hiding fears or frustrations—are often perceived as disconnected and inauthentic. Contrary to conventional wisdom, acknowledging limitations can strengthen rather than undermine leadership credibility.\n\nAs generative AI tools become integrated into leadership practices, this balance of strength and humility will require careful calibration. Leaders will have access to enhanced decision support systems and data analysis capabilities, potentially amplifying both their strengths and weaknesses. The tools that provide clarity and perspective-taking could either reinforce arrogance or foster greater humility, depending on how they're employed.\n\nLeaders who combine decisiveness with openness to alternative viewpoints may navigate the BANI landscape more successfully than those who rely solely on projecting strength. This approach—exercising strength while maintaining humility—appears better suited to environments where brittleness and uncertainty are constant companions.	2025-03-20 11:48:16.499081+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f844ae0e-0bdf-484e-b9f9-c635f6918720.jpg

As transparency tools become ubiquitous and scrutiny intensifies, women leaders often experience disproportionate levels of criticism compared to their male counterparts. This creates a paradox where women must demonstrate strength while navigating societal expectations around humility that differ from those placed on men.\n\nEllen Galinsky's example of quiet transparency offers valuable insights. As president of the Families and Work Institute, Galinsky has reframed work-life balance as "navigation," acknowledging that perfect balance is impossible. Her approach—being energetic and outgoing without self-promotion—demonstrates how women can lead with authority while avoiding the backlash that often comes with self-advocacy. Galinsky has become renowned in her field not through self-promotion but by consistently delivering substantive contributions that others recognize and amplify.\n\nFor women leaders, augmented tools present both opportunities and challenges. GenAI can help identify gender-based biases in communication, providing real-time feedback when a woman's message might be perceived differently than the same message from a male counterpart. These tools can analyze patterns in meeting dynamics, highlighting when women's ideas are overlooked or when they face interruptions at higher rates.\n\nLooking forward ten years, we can envision leadership environments where augmentation helps level the playing field. Imagine AI systems that anonymize contributions in virtual meetings until ideas can be evaluated on merit alone, or tools that provide private coaching on navigating gender expectations in leadership moments. These technologies could help women leaders maintain their authentic voices while strategically managing the strength-with-humility dilemma.\n\nThe futureback approach suggests that women leaders should define their preferred future state—perhaps one where leadership effectiveness is measured by impact rather than conformity to gendered expectations—and work backward to determine which augmentation tools will help them navigate toward that vision while maintaining their integrity and effectiveness.\n\nLike Galinsky's work-life navigation concept, women's leadership in the augmented future will involve both fixed obstacles and fluid currents, requiring continuous adaptation rather than rigid formulas for success.	2025-03-20 12:08:43.790528+00	2	f	f

The BANI world—characterized by brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility—presents challenges that neither humans nor machines can address alone.\n\nLeaders who adopt futureback thinking (looking ten years ahead, then planning backward to the present) may develop what could be called "augmented discernment"—the ability to determine when human judgment should prevail and when algorithmic insights might offer valuable perspective. This builds upon the human calming skill described in the ten future leadership skills, where leaders ground their decisions in intention, discernment, and self-discipline.\n\nThe distinction between present-forward and futureback approaches becomes particularly relevant when considering how leaders might engage with generative AI. Some leaders might focus primarily on efficiency gains—using AI to automate tasks and increase speed. Others might explore how these technologies could expand cognitive horizons, serving as thought partners to explore possibilities beyond conventional thinking.\n\nOne possible development is the emergence of collaborative leadership structures where human leaders work alongside AI systems across organizational boundaries. Such arrangements could potentially address complex challenges by combining human creativity with computational pattern recognition.\n\nThe depolarizing skill—the ability to constructively address conflict and improve polarized situations—may become increasingly important as algorithmic systems sometimes reinforce existing biases. Leaders might need to recognize when technology is creating echo chambers and apply human judgment to counterbalance these effects.\n\nSimilarly, the human calming skill could expand to include creating psychologically safe environments where people can process their feelings about technological change. This connects to the strength-with-humility skill, where leaders maintain a strong presence while expressing that presence humbly.\n\nSuccessful leaders might develop the capacity to move between different knowledge domains, using AI to supplement their understanding while maintaining a perspective grounded in human values. This approach neither rejects technology nor surrenders human judgment to it, but instead explores how human-machine collaboration might address increasingly complex challenges.	2025-03-20 15:57:48.706526+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/53929b43-75b8-4c4e-9f4b-9fa83c15e060.jpg

As pervasive computing makes transparency inevitable, women in politics will need to develop their own versions of strength with humility.\n\nEllen Galinsky's approach offers a valuable model. As president of the Families and Work Institute, Galinsky became renowned for her work on work-life navigation without self-promotion. She speaks, writes, and organizes to spread her message, becoming a trusted authority interviewed whenever issues arise around work and family life. People come to her rather than her advertising herself. This quiet transparency allows her to maintain credibility while still having significant impact.\n\nFor women politicians, generative AI tools will enhance perspective-taking abilities. Similar to how the Sisu.is app helps translate communication across different personality types, future AI systems might help women politicians navigate the complex terrain of gender expectations in leadership. These tools won't eliminate bias but will provide real-time feedback on how messages might be received by different audiences.\n\nSmart mob swarming—where large groups come together for common purpose using digital media—may create alternative pathways to political influence. The Center for Creative Leadership's work on "putting something in the middle" to facilitate dialogue across polarized groups could be particularly valuable for women navigating political divides. Their card decks and visual libraries help establish constructive dialogue when direct conversation is difficult.\n\nReverse-mentoring arrangements, where younger women politicians guide older colleagues on evolving social norms while learning institutional knowledge, might help bridge generational divides within political organizations.\n\nThe challenge for women in politics will be balancing the benefits of AI-augmented leadership with authentic human connection. Those who can effectively coordinate augmented smart mob swarms—being clear about direction while flexible about methods—may find new routes to influence that work alongside traditional political structures.	2025-03-20 16:21:11.387627+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a5c97d0d-5643-4bde-b7c8-7895ea507074.jpg

When leaders engage in questionable practices, the evidence will likely be captured somewhere in the expanding web of pervasive computing networks that grow from the edges and cannot be controlled. NGOs, which have already created certification systems for environmental practices like Fair Trade Certified coffee and Marine Stewardship Council fishing, will develop similar frameworks for leadership ethics.\n\nThese certification systems will use data from pervasive computing to evaluate leadership practices, creating new standards for transparency. However, like carbon footprints—which vary based on calculation methods and assumptions—measures of corruption will not be absolute. What constitutes ethical leadership in one context may differ in another, particularly in a world that Thomas Friedman describes as both flat and jagged.\n\nLeaders practicing strength with humility will need to balance transparency with discretion. Ellen Galinsky's approach of quiet leadership offers a model: focusing on impact rather than self-promotion reduces the temptation toward corrupt practices that often accompany celebrity leadership status. The most effective leaders will be those who, as Pine and Gilmore suggest, maintain authenticity while moving toward transformational leadership.\n\nGenerative AI will provide tools for both detecting and potentially enabling corruption. Digital twins might help leaders identify ethical blind spots before they become problems. At the same time, leaders will need constructive depolarization skills to distinguish between genuine ethical concerns and manufactured controversies designed to create conflict.\n\nThe commons-creating skill will become essential as leaders work across organizational boundaries to establish shared ethical standards. Just as industry associations can use pervasive computing to provide shared measures around safety, they might develop similar approaches to governance and ethics.\n\nIn this environment, leaders who balance strength with humility—who listen carefully, take responsibility for their actions, and practice transparent communication—will be best positioned to navigate the complex ethical landscape of the future.	2025-03-20 16:32:15.654416+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/8a971787-1c34-442d-9446-cc33c385a328.jpg

These young people, who grew up with generative AI as part of their formative experiences, will bring distinctive capabilities to leadership roles.\n\nThe background insights reveal that digital natives can be characterized by several traits: they tend to be more accepting of diversity, skeptical about labeling others, concerned about climate disruption, and often asset poor. Many have a gameful mindset and are superconnected while being savvy about protecting their personal data. However, these characteristics vary dramatically across different regions and even within age cohorts.\n\nYoung leaders in 2035 will likely approach augmented leadership with a natural fluency. Having grown up during the emergence of social media, cloud computing, and generative AI, they will integrate these tools into their leadership practice without the adaptation period required by older generations. Their futureback curiosity—the strong desire to learn driven by wonder and an urge to explore and test new ideas—will be enhanced by their lifelong exposure to rapid technological change.\n\nThe fracturing of social cohesion predicted in the background insights suggests that youth leadership will not be uniform. As the book notes, "By 2035, the children of today will have aged into young adults whose social cohesion will be fractured, with various ideological groups at odds with one another, holding perspectives on life and work that will diverge from earlier generational similarities."\n\nYoung leaders will need to develop strength with humility—leading with quiet transparency while remaining authentic but not self-advertising. They will need to organize smart mob swarms, creating and nurturing purposeful networks through intelligent use of digital media and coordinating humans and generative agents.\n\nMany young people entering leadership positions will have grown up with climate concerns and may prioritize bio-engagement—not just empathy for nature but active engagement with urgent climate challenges. Their commons creating skill will be essential as they work to establish shared assets within which both cooperation and competition can occur.\n\nThe human calming skill—grounding leadership in clarity of intention, discerning choices, and self-discipline—will be particularly important for youth leaders who have grown up in an environment of constant digital stimulation. This skill will help them maintain focus on what matters most amid the technological noise.	2025-03-20 16:35:10.260958+00	1	f	f

These young people, who grew up with generative AI as part of their daily lives, will develop certain leadership capabilities through immersive learning environments that blend gaming with real-world challenges.\n\nThe book notes that "many of today's leaders did not grow up with digital media in their earliest years" and defines a digital native as "someone who is age 29 or younger in 2025." As these individuals mature, their relationship with technology will differ fundamentally from previous generations. Their digital twins may interact with other digital twins, creating new pathways for understanding complex leadership dilemmas without requiring the same timeline of traditional experience.\n\nThis creates a tension in several possible directions. In one scenario, established age requirements for leadership roles remain fixed, creating frustration among capable young leaders who feel artificially constrained. In another scenario, some organizations experiment with "capability-based" qualifications, using the "advanced decision support" mentioned in the book to evaluate a person's depolarizing skills and strength with humility.\n\nThe book observes that "GenAI will help leaders learn how to fail gracefully if they are not knowledgeable about a subject—without having to pretend they know what they're talking about." This capability might enable younger individuals to compensate for certain types of experience gaps through AI support systems.\n\nSome institutions may resist this change, emphasizing the "active empathy" and "open communication" skills described in the depolarization checklist—qualities traditionally associated with maturity and life experience. Others might embrace the "neuro-adaptable" qualities of younger leaders who demonstrate an "instinct for improvisation" in BANI conditions.\n\nSmart mob swarms organized by younger leaders might advocate for reconsidering age requirements in political systems. The book notes that smart mob swarms "do not wait to be given a title or position to take responsibility," suggesting that formal age requirements may become less relevant as alternative power structures emerge.	2025-03-20 16:38:06.411451+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/8b774e1b-e1ac-4ff1-b417-5e0224349ed8.jpg

This evolution builds directly on Douglas Engelbart's vision described in his 1962 essay where he imagined a world where human intuition and "feel for a situation" would coexist with powerful technological aids. The book's exploration of augmentation shows this isn't merely about efficiency but about expanding human capability.\n\nThe ten leadership skills outlined in the book will evolve through personalized augmentation approaches. For example, a leader might develop their own augmentation ecosystem to enhance their Clarity skill (chapter 3) while simultaneously strengthening their Dilemma Flipping capabilities (chapter 4). This personalization connects to what the book describes as the shift from "prompts and answer-finding" to "mind-stretching interactions" in the conclusion's Table 3.\n\nLeaders will need to avoid what we could term "augmentation dependency" – overreliance on GenAI tools at the expense of developing core human capabilities. Instead, they'll practice what aligns with Kentaro Toyama's framework mentioned in chapter 11: maintaining intention about their leadership purpose, discernment about which tasks benefit from AI augmentation, and self-control to prevent technological overreliance.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility of the BANI world described throughout the book. For instance, the Human Calming skill (chapter 11) becomes even more critical as leaders must determine which aspects of leadership remain fundamentally human while leveraging GenAI for appropriate augmentation.\n\nThe book's conclusion emphasizes that GenAI will disrupt leadership, but how this disruption plays out remains a human choice. Leaders who thoughtfully design their augmentation approach – choosing which skills to enhance and how – will be better positioned to navigate the complex futures ahead while maintaining their humanity. This represents the book's core argument that GenAI can help leaders humanize their leadership rather than inevitably dehumanizing it.	2025-03-20 17:03:24.3301+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/34b11dd5-8cb1-4f86-8cfe-e1e77105ebb4.jpg

These leaders will emerge from unexpected places, including many who are currently under 29 years old in 2025—the first generation to become adults in the era of social media, cloud computing, and generative AI.\n\nFutureback curiosity—the ability to look ahead ten years and work backward to inform present decisions—will become the foundation of effective leadership. This skill combines what was previously called the maker instinct with rapid prototyping, allowing leaders to approach challenges with both the commitment of a job and the playful energy of a hobby. As demonstrated by IDEO's design process, where designers created nearly a hundred versions of the PalmPilot before reaching the final product, future leaders will embrace failure as a necessary step toward success.\n\nThe demographic reality suggests a troubling signal: a significant portion of digital natives will be simultaneously hungry, hopeless, educated, and connected. This combination creates potential for both breakthrough innovation and destructive conflict. Some of these young people will become leaders who approach climate disruption with bio-engagement—not merely empathy for nature, but active involvement in addressing urgent environmental challenges.\n\nLeaders will need to become what Amber Case calls "cyborgs"—extending their capabilities through technology to thrive in uncertain environments. However, unlike astronauts whose spacesuits are visible extensions, leadership augmentation will often be invisible, embedded in the algorithms and agents that leaders orchestrate. This will require strength with humility—projecting confidence while acknowledging the limitations of both human and machine intelligence.\n\nSmart mob swarming will replace traditional organizational structures, with leaders orchestrating networks of humans and generative agents to address complex challenges. These swarms will form, accomplish specific tasks, and dissolve as needed, creating more fluid and responsive approaches to leadership than today's hierarchical models.\n\nHuman calming—the ability to center oneself in clear intention, discerning choices, and self-discipline—will become the essential counterbalance to technological augmentation. In a world where everything can be measured but measurements can be manipulated, leaders will need to cultivate this skill to maintain focus on what truly matters amid the noise of ubiquitous computing and mandatory transparency.	2025-03-20 17:56:43.543457+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f181727a-857e-4378-ae29-a64e24a31512.jpg

We might see the emergence of what could be called "distributed sovereignty" – leadership that operates through networks rather than traditional hierarchies. Those who effectively lead in the future might not necessarily be those with formal titles, but individuals who can skillfully orchestrate what the book describes as "smart mob swarms of humans and AI agents" toward shared objectives.\n\nFuture leadership may require mastery of several of the ten leadership skills outlined in the book, particularly commons creating, smart mob swarming, and strength with humility. Effective leaders might be those who can create shared spaces where both cooperation and competition flourish, potentially using generative AI to help evaluate different scenarios and test governance approaches.\n\nThese leaders will likely operate in environments where, as the book suggests, "transparency will be mandatory in many environments" through various measurement devices and ubiquitous computing. As Amber Case, described in the book as "the world's first cyborg anthropologist," suggests, leaders may need to become "cyborgs" – humans extended by technology – to effectively lead. Case defines a cyborg as "an extension of an organism for the purpose of surviving and thriving in a new, uncertain, or changing environment," similar to astronauts wearing spacesuits.\n\nThe demographic composition of future leadership could include many "digital natives" – defined in the book as those who were 29 or younger in 2025 – who grew up with social media, cloud computing, and generative AI as their native media environment. The book characterizes these individuals as "more accepting of diversity and skeptical about labeling others," often possessing "a gameful mindset," while potentially carrying "untreated childhood trauma, asset poverty, and anger about climate disruption."\n\nOne possible pathway for future leadership might involve what could be termed "orchestrated emergence" – guiding what the book calls "shape-shifting distributed organizations" by optimizing communications networks while maintaining organizational culture. The book suggests that "the Saul Alinsky of cyberspace" – referring to the iconic community organizer – might possibly emerge not as a single person but as a collaborative swarm of humans and AI agents, potentially creating novel forms of collective action.	2025-03-20 18:45:38.1382+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/48d20952-7e73-488f-a49e-15cfde2d615a.jpg

As pervasive computing creates unprecedented transparency, all leaders will face increased scrutiny, but historical patterns suggest women will navigate different expectations than their male counterparts.\n\nEllen Galinsky's leadership at the Families and Work Institute demonstrates an effective approach to this dilemma. Rather than self-promotion, Galinsky built authority through substantive expertise in work-life navigation. Her method of being "engaged and open but not overselling" allowed her to become a recognized authority while maintaining an "understated style by design." As she demonstrated, one can "become an authority on a single substantive issue without developing an inflated ego." This approach may prove particularly valuable as transparency tools proliferate.\n\nThe augmented strength with humility skill presents specific considerations in this context. GenAI tools could enhance perspective-taking by identifying biases in how leadership behaviors are interpreted across gender lines. The same decisive action might be read as "assertive" or "aggressive" depending on who performs it. Augmented tools could help surface these patterns, allowing for more nuanced navigation of leadership expectations.\n\nThe commons creating skill may offer another pathway. The certification revolution described in the background insights shows how NGOs are creating new measurement systems based on shared values. Similar approaches could establish leadership commons that recognize diverse leadership approaches rather than defaulting to traditional models.\n\nThe human calming skill might emerge as particularly significant. As automation handles more analytical tasks, the ability to ground leadership in "clarity of intention, discerning choices, and self-discipline" becomes more valuable. This skill transcends gender while acknowledging how different leaders might approach it.\n\nMultiple possible futures exist for women's leadership in the augmented age. In one pathway, augmentation might reinforce existing biases by codifying them in algorithms. In another, the combination of increased transparency and augmented perspective-taking could create more nuanced understanding of effective leadership across gender lines. The signals visible today suggest both possibilities remain open.	2025-03-20 18:59:11.159828+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/8aa77f5b-cf59-499f-a323-7c30118b9674.jpg

GenAI tools can analyze vast datasets of consumer behavior, identifying patterns that human marketers might miss. The Butterflies application, which helps teams coordinate in real-time, points toward a future where AI marketing assistants might orchestrate complex multi-channel campaigns while human creatives focus on emotional resonance and brand storytelling.\n\nPhysical retail spaces could evolve into what James Gilmore and Joseph Pine describe as "authenticity theaters" – environments where consumers don't just purchase products but participate in meaningful experiences. One signal of this shift appears in the growing certification movement documented by Michael Conroy, where consumers demand transparent verification of product origins and manufacturing conditions. GenAI might enable instant access to a product's complete supply chain history through augmented reality overlays when a customer examines an item.\n\nA surprising development may emerge in how retail spaces function as data collection environments. Beyond simply tracking purchases, physical stores could become laboratories for understanding subtle consumer behaviors – how long someone holds a product, their facial expressions when examining price tags, or conversation patterns when shopping with companions. This data, ethically collected and analyzed through GenAI, could inform not just marketing but product development in ways impossible through online shopping alone.\n\nMapping multiple pathways reveals divergent possibilities. In one scenario, retail becomes increasingly frictionless, with GenAI handling all transactional elements invisibly. In another, intentional friction points are designed into experiences – moments where consumers are invited to slow down, consider options, and engage more deeply with products. A third possibility sees community-based retail collectives using GenAI to coordinate inventory and logistics across independent businesses, creating alternatives to corporate retail giants.\n\nThe dilemma for marketing leaders involves balancing personalization with privacy. GenAI enables unprecedented customization, but as Kentaro Toyama emphasizes, effective implementation requires intention, discernment, and self-control. Marketing leaders must develop clear frameworks for when personalization enhances consumer experience versus when it feels intrusive.\n\nSmart mob organizing principles could transform how brands engage with consumer communities. Rather than broadcasting messages, brands might use GenAI to identify micro-communities of interest and provide tools for these groups to self-organize around shared values or activities, with the brand playing a supporting rather than directing role.	2025-04-08 00:01:54.208194+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/739c984c-004b-46c2-83fc-02370c860e48.jpg

Just as retailers are creating data-rich environments that balance personalization with privacy, universities will develop computing infrastructures that protect sensitive information while enabling open academic exchange.\n\nJim Spohrer's WorldBoard concept offers a useful framework for understanding these future environments. While at Apple in the mid-1990s, Spohrer imagined digital information that could be placed anywhere—floating in air, on walls, trees, or any surface—visible only to authorized users. This "planetary chalkboard" would support not just text but rich media and 3D images, creating an overlay where digital information registers precisely with physical space. As computing costs decrease, this vision will gradually materialize on university campuses.\n\nUniversity cybersecurity programs will likely adopt approaches similar to Campbell's war gaming at the Army War College. Campbell creates immersive simulations where participants practice in low-risk environments, continuously resetting parameters to stretch players without overwhelming them. Universities might develop similar environments where students defend against simulated attacks, gaining practical experience before confronting actual threats.\n\nIdentity management in higher education will evolve beyond current approaches. Universities might implement distributed frameworks where students maintain control of their credentials while providing verifiable proof when accessing resources. This creates a new commons—a shared infrastructure benefiting the entire academic community while preserving individual agency.\n\nFor research data, universities might develop specialized security protocols based on sensitivity levels. Public research might remain openly accessible, while proprietary or national security-related work requires additional verification. GenAI tools could continuously monitor access patterns, identifying anomalies that suggest potential breaches.\n\nCampus physical spaces will increasingly incorporate ambient computing with security built in. Sensors might recognize authorized personnel through multiple factors—not just ID cards but gait analysis, behavioral patterns, and contextual awareness. These systems would operate unobtrusively, embodying what Amber Case calls "calm technology" that requires minimal attention from users.\n\nThe challenge for university leaders will be implementing these systems while preserving the open exchange essential to academic progress. This requires intention, discernment, and self-control—qualities that Kentaro Toyama identifies as crucial for effective technology implementation.	2025-04-08 00:03:03.755953+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/09413c43-1c72-4274-923b-2e3cc9aaab90.jpg

Leaders have always needed to balance opposing forces—authority with collaboration, decisiveness with reflection, tradition with innovation. What changes in the BANI world is how these balances are achieved.\n\nThe Futureback Curiosity Skill, which Bob Johansen describes as a prerequisite for developing robust foresight, connects directly to how leaders have traditionally learned from the past. This skill involves maintaining wonder and intrigue while thinking about the future, rather than being constrained by current knowledge. Leaders who develop this skill can examine historical leadership approaches not as models to copy, but as signals that inform new possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, the Strength—with Humility Skill outlined in the book provides a framework for leadership presence that avoids the pitfalls of celebrity leadership. As the book notes, "The age of the rock star leader is over—with good reason." Leaders who demonstrate both strength and humility listen carefully, remain open to alternative viewpoints, take responsibility for their actions, practice transparent communication, and maintain a service orientation.\n\nLooking toward 2030-2035, we can map multiple pathways for how leaders might integrate historical wisdom with augmented capabilities:\n\nIn one scenario, leaders might use generative AI to analyze historical leadership decisions across cultures and contexts, identifying patterns that human observation alone might miss. This could create a new form of leadership apprenticeship where leaders learn not just from immediate mentors but from a synthesized understanding of leadership across time.\n\nIn another scenario, augmented leadership might enable more distributed decision-making while maintaining coherent direction. Rather than centralizing all wisdom in a single leader, organizations could develop systems where leadership emerges from the interplay between human judgment and machine-assisted pattern recognition.\n\nThe challenge for leaders will be discerning which elements of traditional leadership remain essential in an augmented world and which need to evolve. This requires the kind of dilemma-flipping skill that Johansen identifies—improving situations even when they cannot be fully resolved.	2025-03-20 19:08:28.273701+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/7b5e4706-c34e-4925-b1fc-196cbd8217f3.jpg

Traditional philanthropic models that focus on transactional giving will likely prove insufficient as global challenges become more interconnected and complex.\n\nThe concept of reciprocity-based innovation offers a promising framework for philanthropy's future. Similar to how companies like Hugging Face have created value by intelligently giving away resources to seed new commons, philanthropic organizations might shift toward creating self-sustaining systems rather than perpetual dependency. This approach requires patience—measuring impact over years rather than months—and comfort with uncertainty.\n\nPhilanthropic leaders will need to develop both clarity and flexibility, avoiding the trap of brittle certainty that breaks badly in unpredictable environments. They might benefit from adopting a futureback perspective, imagining possibilities from ten years ahead while studying patterns from decades past. This dual focus could help philanthropic organizations avoid repeating historical mistakes while creating new possibilities.\n\nThe increasing availability of measurement tools will make philanthropic impact more visible, though not necessarily more accurate. As everything becomes measurable, philanthropic organizations may find it both easier to demonstrate impact and harder to make sense of what truly matters. Leaders will need to distinguish between efficiency (doing things right) and effectiveness (doing the right things).\n\nYoung people entering philanthropy bring different perspectives shaped by their digital experiences. Many have grown up with climate concerns, economic uncertainty, and digital connectivity. Their involvement may push philanthropy toward more collaborative, technology-enabled approaches that bridge traditional divides.\n\nGenerative AI tools could help philanthropic organizations prototype different possible actions, helping them navigate the space between deciding too soon and too late. These tools might assist in identifying common ground across polarized positions, though the human element of leadership—the ability to build trust and shared values—will remain essential.\n\nThe challenge for philanthropy will be balancing technological augmentation with human-centered approaches, using new tools to enhance rather than replace the fundamental human connections that drive meaningful change.	2025-03-21 00:50:41.113707+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ab4607c2-0981-421a-a388-5fe26b1d59db.jpg

As generative AI enables new forms of "shape-shifting social coordination," we can already observe how online male-centered communities leverage technology to amplify their influence. These communities will likely evolve from today's forums and social media enclaves into sophisticated swarms of humans and AI agents working in concert.\n\nConsider how the Butterflies AI platform, where users spend hours interacting with AI characters in an Instagram-like environment, could evolve in the context of gender-focused communities. The manosphere could potentially deploy similar technologies to create immersive environments where human users interact with AI characters that reinforce specific worldviews about gender relations. These AI-human swarms might operate with greater coordination and impact than today's loosely affiliated online communities.\n\nLeaders addressing these challenges will need the skills outlined in the Augmented Smart Mob Swarming checklist. They must maintain clarity about their values while remaining flexible about tactics. The neuro-adaptability to pivot quickly will be essential when confronting swarms that can rapidly shift their approach. Most importantly, they must understand how their messages will be "transmuted through memes and online discourse" – particularly when addressing gender issues that often become lightning rods for online controversy.\n\nWomen leaders may face particular challenges as the manosphere evolves into more sophisticated swarms. The "not-so-smart mob swarms" mentioned could specifically target women in leadership positions with coordinated campaigns that leverage AI to scale harassment or disinformation. Conversely, women-led organizations might develop counter-swarms that create supportive networks and commons.\n\nThe commons creating skill becomes especially relevant here. Leaders will need to establish digital spaces where productive conversations about gender can occur without being overwhelmed by hostile swarms. Generative AI could help evaluate scenarios for how these commons might function while assessing risks.\n\nAs Howard Rheingold's concept of "smart mobs" evolves into the "generative many," the question becomes whether these technologies will amplify existing gender conflicts or create new possibilities for understanding. The answer likely depends on which leaders most effectively master augmented smart mob swarming skills.	2025-03-21 02:52:17.182009+00	2	f	f

While examining the bibliography that has shaped leadership thinking, we can project how these ideas will evolve into new forms of augmented leadership literature.\n\nDouglas Engelbart's 1962 paper "Augmenting Human Intellect" established the foundation for how technology might extend rather than replace human capabilities. This concept will likely evolve into practical frameworks for leaders navigating AI partnerships. Future leadership books will build on Thomas Malone's work in "Superminds," offering specific protocols for how leadership teams can integrate human and machine intelligence to address increasingly complex challenges.\n\nIn what Jamais Cascio describes as our BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—leadership books will need to provide concrete tools for pattern recognition across disparate domains. The concept of "full-spectrum thinking" introduced in earlier work will expand into detailed methodologies for leaders to recognize connections between seemingly unrelated signals of change.\n\nLeadership development literature will likely incorporate AI-powered simulations that allow leaders to practice navigating extreme disruption scenarios. Building on the Center for Creative Leadership's global scaling efforts, these books might include embedded AI coaches that customize development pathways based on a leader's specific context and challenges.\n\nThe distributed nature of work explored in "Office Shock" suggests future leadership books will address how to maintain human connection across digital divides. These works might explore how leaders can create psychological safety in environments where team members collaborate with both humans and AI systems.\n\nAs Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan explored in "AI 2041," the relationship between humans and AI will continue evolving. Future leadership books will likely provide frameworks for ethical decision-making when leadership responsibilities are shared between human judgment and algorithmic recommendations, offering leaders practical guidance for maintaining human values in increasingly automated organizations.	2025-03-22 20:19:48.782504+00	1	f	f

These individuals, having grown up with social media, cloud computing, and generative AI, will approach leadership with fundamentally different perspectives than previous generations.\n\nThe book notes that digital natives are "more accepting of diversity and skeptical about labeling others," with many harboring anger about climate disruption and the lack of action by older generations. This emotional connection to environmental issues will likely evolve into leadership approaches that prioritize climate solutions, similar to how Ellen Galinsky pioneered work-life navigation through persistent, humble advocacy rather than self-promotion.\n\nThe asset poverty experienced by many young people, as mentioned in the background material, will influence how they create and share resources. Having experienced economic constraints firsthand, these leaders may naturally gravitate toward what the book calls "commons creating" - establishing shared assets that enable both cooperation and competition.\n\nThe fracturing of social cohesion predicted for 2035 presents a particular challenge. As the book states, "by 2035, the children of today will have aged into young adults whose social cohesion will be fractured, with various ideological groups at odds with one another." Leaders emerging from this environment will need exceptional skills in what the book terms "depolarizing" - the ability to constructively address conflict and improve polarized situations.\n\nYoung leaders will likely embody the "strength with humility" approach described in the book, where leaders "do the right thing and be transparent, but don't be self-promotional." This approach aligns with the observation that in an increasingly media-rich world, good behavior will be noticed without self-advertisement.\n\nFor organizations developing young leaders, creating environments that acknowledge their technological fluency while fostering human connection will be essential to balance augmentation with what the book calls "human calming" - leadership grounded in clear intention and self-discipline.	2025-03-21 07:13:26.052925+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/1ca097c9-eca8-4f9c-b4d2-047f1800f851.jpg

In the BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—leaders must navigate complex international dynamics with both technological sophistication and human wisdom.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness that emerges when groups believe they are absolutely right while others are wrong becomes particularly dangerous in international relations. When leaders of different nations or factions operate with rigid certainty rather than clarity, diplomatic breakdowns occur. Augmented leaders will need to maintain what Johansen calls "clarity about what they know while acknowledging what they don't know."\n\nCross-cultural grace becomes essential as leaders engage across diverse contexts. Anthropologist Edward T. Hall, who trained diplomats to understand cultural differences, noted that we must recognize the hidden aspects of communication. Today's world stage includes not just national and ethnic differences but also generational, ideological, and technological divides that leaders must bridge.\n\nThe Episcopal Church example shows how even within a single faith tradition, leaders must navigate deep polarities. Similarly, world leaders will need to create spaces where competing interests can find common ground despite fundamental differences. These digital and physical commons will allow for both cooperation and competition to coexist.\n\nStrength with humility takes on special importance as measurement tools become ubiquitous. Just as NGOs now monitor corporate behavior through certification systems like Fair Trade, international leaders will face constant scrutiny. The most effective will demonstrate what Johansen calls "quiet transparency"—being authentic without self-promotion.\n\nAs AI systems become integrated into diplomatic processes, human calming emerges as a critical skill. Leaders must ground their decisions in human intention and discernment rather than algorithmic recommendations alone. This human-centered approach will distinguish truly effective global leaders in an increasingly augmented diplomatic landscape.	2025-03-21 07:39:51.359179+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/2dafbecf-0f94-4d21-8963-9367bd7e77f9.jpg

As digital tools and AI systems increasingly mediate human interactions across borders, leaders must create commons that protect fundamental rights while allowing for cultural diversity. The challenge lies in developing frameworks that are neither rigidly universal nor completely relativistic.\n\nThe Honey Bee Network, founded by Dr. Anil Gupta at the Indian Institute of Management, offers a compelling model. This network documents traditional knowledge and grassroots innovations across India, Mongolia, Kenya, Vietnam, Uganda, Colombia, Ecuador, and North America. Its "honey bee philosophy" emphasizes cross-pollination of ideas and bringing innovations to the public domain. With 100,000 ideas and practices shared across 75 countries, it demonstrates how human rights can be advanced through collaborative knowledge commons rather than imposed standards.\n\nBrazil's leadership in open-source movements similarly points to future approaches for human rights. When the government began supporting a shift from proprietary Microsoft software to open-source Linux alternatives, it wasn't merely a technological decision but a rights-based one. As Sérgio Amadeu argued in "Digital Exclusion: Misery in the Information Era," such moves help close the digital divide between technologically enabled and deprived communities. Ronaldo Lemos extended this thinking through Creative Commons licensing and Overmundo, a collaborative community reporting platform that undergoes peer review before publication.\n\nThese examples suggest that future human rights frameworks will need to balance universal principles with local implementation. Augmented leaders will create what Edgar Schein calls "humble inquiry" spaces—physical and digital environments where rights are negotiated rather than dictated. The National Geographic's Genographic Project, which maps humanity's historical migrations through DNA, offers another model for understanding human connectedness beyond national boundaries.\n\nAs climate-induced migrations accelerate, leaders will need to develop commons that preserve basic values while accommodating diversity. This requires moving beyond the traditional Western conception of individual rights toward what Kentaro Toyama calls the "three pillars of wisdom"—intention, discernment, and self-control—applied to collective rights frameworks that can adapt to rapidly changing global conditions.	2025-03-21 10:37:30.164363+00	2	f	f

This evolution builds directly on what we've described as the ten future leadership skills, particularly the need for futureback curiosity and human calming.\n\nAs we've explored throughout this book, the BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—requires leaders who can navigate complexity not through certainty but through clarity. Generative AI will serve as a tool for this navigation, helping leaders make sense of chaotic environments while maintaining their human-centered purpose.\n\nThe concept of "augmentation literacy" will become essential—the ability to discern when and how to engage with generative systems. This extends our discussion of the dilemma-flipping skill, as leaders will need to determine which leadership functions should remain exclusively human and which can benefit from technological enhancement.\n\nWe see early indicators of this future in how forward-thinking executives are beginning to use GenAI not merely for efficiency but to expand their cognitive capacity. This allows them to consider more variables simultaneously and explore multiple potential futures—a direct application of the futureback thinking approach we outlined earlier.\n\nLeadership development will need to evolve beyond teaching fixed competencies toward fostering adaptive learning that evolves with each leader's unique augmentation journey. This connects to our discussion of immersive learning, where leaders must become comfortable in unfamiliar digital environments.\n\nThe shift from present-forward thinking (focused on efficiency and automation) to futureback vision (centered on effectiveness and meaning-making) will be crucial. As Table 1 in Chapter 2 illustrates, successful leaders will maintain human clarity of purpose while leveraging artificial capabilities to navigate complexity.\n\nThis future of leadership reinforces our core message: the most effective leaders will be those who can orchestrate human-machine collaborations while remaining grounded in human values and intentions.	2025-03-21 11:00:41.400028+00	1	f	f

The command-and-control approach that dominated much of the 20th century emerged from military structures where clear hierarchies enabled coordinated action. As documented in "Patton's Principles: A Handbook for Managers Who Mean It!", leaders like General Patton emphasized decisiveness and authority within well-defined chains of command.\n\nThe introduction of networked computing marked a significant shift. Douglas Engelbart, whose pioneering work at the Stanford Research Institute in the 1960s introduced the concept of "augmenting human intellect," envisioned technology not as replacing human capability but enhancing it. His demonstrations of early collaborative computing systems showed how technology could extend human cognitive abilities rather than simply automate existing processes.\n\nOrganizations like IDEO transformed this philosophy into practical innovation methods. Their rapid prototyping approach—creating quick, rough versions of products using materials from their "tech boxes" filled with diverse materials from around the world—allowed them to fail early and iterate quickly. As noted in the background material, IDEO designers created nearly a hundred versions of the PalmPilot, from crude foam cutouts to machine-shop prototypes, learning from each failure to improve the next iteration.\n\nBy 2035, leadership will likely bifurcate into two complementary paths. One path will follow what we might call the "augmented technician" model, where leaders become exceptionally skilled at orchestrating human-AI collaborations, creating smart mob swarms that combine human creativity with algorithmic processing power. These leaders will excel at what Bob Johansen calls "dilemma flipping"—transforming seemingly unsolvable problems into opportunities through human-machine partnerships.\n\nThe alternative path might produce "neo-traditionalists" who deliberately limit technological augmentation in favor of cultivating distinctly human capabilities like bio-engagement and human calming. These leaders will create spaces where people can disconnect from augmentation to reconnect with natural systems and human relationships.\n\nRather than one approach dominating, these paths will likely coexist and complement each other, with leaders moving fluidly between them depending on the context. The most effective leaders will develop what the IFTF calls "futureback curiosity"—combining the maker instinct with rapid prototyping to create solutions that address the increasingly brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible challenges of our world.	2025-03-21 11:03:09.847917+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4da0cb87-c2b6-4022-96fd-9dbb163bda11.jpg

The concept of bio-engagement, which requires seeing things from nature's point of view and respecting its cycles, offers a framework for reimagining how leaders approach human connections.\n\nVirj Kan demonstrates this expanded notion of bio-engagement through her work with purple sea urchins along the California coast. After the death of the urchins' natural predators around 2015, their population exploded, decimating kelp forests and threatening marine ecosystems. Rather than viewing this solely as an environmental problem, Kan, trained in biomaterials at MIT, created Primitives Biodesign to transform these destructive urchins into valuable products like tiles and furniture. She regularly leads culling dives and works with local fishermen, showing how bio-engagement involves both practical solutions and deep immersion in the systems we seek to influence.\n\nSimilarly, the Salatin family's Polyface Farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley exemplifies bio-engagement principles through their approach to agriculture. Their commitment to "respecting and honoring the 'pigness' of the pig" represents a fundamental recognition that all living beings have inherent value and purpose. By designing farming systems that allow animals to express their natural behaviors, they've created an operation that produces healthy food while honoring life's intrinsic worth.\n\nIn the future, leaders will need to apply these bio-engagement principles to human relationships. Just as Scott Jenkins transformed stadium operations at Safeco Field (now T-Mobile Park) by making energy usage visible to his team and implementing family-friendly policies, future leaders will need to make visible the impacts of their decisions on human well-being and connection.\n\nThe dilemma of balancing technological advancement with human needs will require the kind of dilemma flipping described in the book. Leaders will need to navigate the space between judging too soon and deciding too late, finding ways to use technology to enhance rather than replace human connection.\n\nAs we look ahead, bio-engagement will become a critical leadership skill not just for environmental sustainability but for creating systems where love and life are recognized as essential components of successful organizations and societies.	2025-04-06 15:36:11.103885+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/b255c5fd-c110-4e8c-83bb-02885a3a4f8a.jpg

The background insights highlight Ellen Galinsky's work at the Families and Work Institute as an exemplar of quiet transparency. Rather than promoting herself, Galinsky has focused on reframing work-life balance as "navigation," recognizing that competing demands represent ongoing dilemmas to be managed rather than problems to be solved.\n\nAs pervasive computing networks become more ubiquitous, leaders will face unprecedented scrutiny. Michael Conroy's research, detailed in his book "Branded!," describes how nongovernmental organizations are creating new certification systems to monitor corporations when traditional regulation fails. For example, Fair Trade Certified monitors coffee and chocolate, while Marine Stewardship Council encourages sustainable fishing practices. These certification systems represent a fundamental shift in how leadership performance will be evaluated.\n\nThis certification revolution creates two possible futures for leadership. In one scenario, leaders might retreat behind carefully managed public personas, limiting transparency to avoid scrutiny. In an alternative future, leaders could embrace what the background insights call "open-source thinking," where they "release exclusive ownership and have the faith to be transparent." This approach aligns with the quiet transparency demonstrated by Galinsky.\n\nThe background insights note that "the best leaders understand that if they give ideas away generously, in return, they will get back even better ideas." This principle could reshape leadership development in unexpected ways. For instance, future leadership training might focus on developing what the text calls "quiet leaders" who "are content to lead while others get the attention."\n\nThe core dilemma identified in the background insights—"How do you reach your full leadership potential and become well known without advertising yourself?"—will become increasingly relevant as measurement tools become pervasive. Leaders who successfully navigate this dilemma by focusing on contribution rather than recognition may develop more sustainable leadership approaches that thrive in environments where, as the text notes, "any record of bad behavior will be preserved."	2025-03-21 13:41:54.675369+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/be4b3cec-16f3-4f0a-9b89-df8571c19af3.jpg

This approach, which we might call "road mad," embraces the apparent chaos of constant change while maintaining clear direction.\n\nRoad mad leadership builds on the futureback curiosity skill we discussed earlier—the ability to look ten years ahead and then work backward to determine immediate next steps. It incorporates rapid prototyping, where leaders minimize planning but maximize learning-by-doing in low-risk settings. Just as IDEO demonstrates with their evolution of products like the PalmPilot (from crude foam cutouts to final products), leaders must expect to fail early to succeed later.\n\nThe road mad approach requires developing what David Kelley of IDEO might recognize as "creative discomfort." IDEO's workspaces—with their repurposed DC-3 aircraft parts and converted Volkswagen buses—demonstrate how unusual environments stimulate innovation. Similarly, future leaders will need environments that challenge their assumptions and foster new thinking patterns.\n\nSmart mob swarms, as we explored in Chapter 9, become essential to road mad leadership. Rather than controlling change, leaders will initiate multiple experiments across their organizations. Like Jimmy Wales did with Wikipedia, where volunteer editors maintain a knowledge commons, leaders will provide clear intent while allowing flexibility in execution.\n\nThe strength-with-humility skill becomes particularly crucial in this approach. Leaders must demonstrate strength to maintain direction amid chaos while having the humility to listen and adapt. As Ed and Peter Shein suggest in their work on humble inquiry, the art of asking rather than telling becomes essential when navigating uncharted territory.\n\nThe road mad approach isn't about embracing chaos for its own sake—it's about developing the capacity to thrive within it. Leaders who can maintain their human calming skill—grounding their leadership in clarity of intention, discerning choices, and self-discipline—while navigating seemingly mad environments will guide their organizations through the BANI future, turning potential roadblocks into opportunities for innovation.	2025-03-21 13:57:22.413915+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f4be00aa-3e91-4242-9023-39701468f64d.jpg

The brittleness of our current risk frameworks becomes evident when they encounter nonlinear events that don't follow historical patterns. Traditional risk management often assumes predictable cause-effect relationships, but in a BANI environment, these assumptions frequently prove inadequate.\n\nLooking futureback from ten years ahead, we can envision risk management becoming less about prevention and more about resilience. Agent systems will likely assist leaders in monitoring weak signals across multiple domains, helping identify patterns that might indicate emerging brittleness before failures occur. However, the value won't come from prediction alone but from preparation.\n\nOrganizations will need to design bendable systems with appropriate redundancies and flexible response mechanisms. This isn't about preventing all risks but ensuring systems can adapt rather than shatter when stressed. The concept of neuro-adaptability applies directly to risk management—leaders must develop the capacity to rethink approaches on the fly when established risk checklists prove insufficient or counterproductive.\n\nScenario planning will likely expand beyond traditional approaches. Instead of relying on single-point forecasts, leaders will need to embrace full-spectrum thinking about risk, considering gradients of possibility rather than binary outcomes. This aligns with the inclusive approach to incomprehensibility described earlier—incorporating diverse perspectives to better understand complex risk landscapes.\n\nThe distinction between clarity and certainty becomes particularly important in risk contexts. Leaders will need to develop what we might call a "risk clarity story"—a coherent understanding of which uncertainties they're willing to embrace and which require mitigation. This clarity, not certainty, will guide decision-making.\n\nRisk management may also benefit from the "putting something in the middle" approach to depolarization. Visual representations of complex risk landscapes could enable constructive dialogue across different viewpoints about acceptable risk thresholds.\n\nThe futureback mindset suggests leaders should imagine resilient futures first, then work backward to identify the flexible bounce ropes—not rigid guardrails—needed to navigate toward those futures. This approach focuses less on preventing specific threats and more on cultivating organizational capabilities that can thrive amid uncertainty.	2025-03-22 03:59:25.681524+00	1	f	f

As we look back from our vantage point in the future, the past appears not as a linear progression but as a complex tapestry of patterns that inform our present decisions.\n\nThe most effective leaders have mastered what we might call "temporal triangulation" - the ability to simultaneously hold perspectives from the distant past (at least 50 years back), the present, and the future (at least 10 years ahead). This practice follows the Institute for the Future's principle that "we look to the future for clarity; we look to the past for patterns."\n\nIn this BANI world, where brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility dominate, the past serves as both anchor and warning. Leaders recognize that historical cycles often repeat with variations, providing valuable context for navigating present chaos. However, they also understand that full-spectrum thinking requires breaking free from the categories and constraints of the past that no longer serve us.\n\nThe past appears differently through the lens of algorithmic orchestration. AI systems have become extraordinary pattern-recognition tools, identifying historical trends and cycles that human perception alone might miss. Yet augmented leaders maintain their human calming skill, recognizing that algorithms can only process what has been recorded, not what has been lived.\n\nLeaders practicing dilemma-flipping see the past not as a binary of successes and failures but as a gradient of experiences that inform future possibilities. They extract insights from historical moments when humanity faced similar challenges of technological disruption, social upheaval, or environmental crisis.\n\nThe commons creating skill has evolved to include temporal commons - shared spaces where past wisdom and future possibilities can productively interact. These commons allow organizations to learn from history without being constrained by it, embracing the futureback mindset that "the goal is to imagine and make a better future while not remaking old mistakes."\n\nIn essence, the past appears to augmented leaders as a vital resource for navigating the BANI future - not as a blueprint to follow, but as a map of patterns that informs their journey toward clarity without certainty.	2025-03-22 07:30:09.38051+00	2	f	f

The next frontier lies in what might be called "curiosity collectives" – decentralized networks of augmented makers who deliberately pursue novelty rather than optimization. These groups will operate with intentionally open-ended objectives, embracing the core insight from "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" that transformative breakthroughs often emerge through circuitous, unplanned paths.\n\nAs generative AI systems become more autonomous in their exploration, we may witness the emergence of AI-augmented curiosity that probes knowledge domains humans have traditionally avoided. The Voyager system that taught itself to create diamond swords in Minecraft with minimal human direction points toward a future where machine curiosity operates with increasing independence. This raises profound questions about how we might harness such capabilities while maintaining appropriate boundaries.\n\nThe maker instinct, when amplified by generative AI, could challenge established systems in unexpected ways. Unlike traditional innovation approaches that seek incremental improvements, these augmented curiosity networks might expose contradictions and fragilities in our social, economic, and political structures simply by asking questions no one thought to ask before. The results could be both destabilizing and regenerative.\n\nLeaders who cling to traditional planning models will struggle in this environment. The future demands those who can orchestrate productive uncertainty – creating conditions where failure isn't merely accepted but actively cultivated as the primary path to discovery. This requires abandoning the comforting illusion of control that has defined leadership for generations.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, augmented curiosity may fundamentally alter how we understand knowledge creation itself. As we partner with AI systems in exploratory processes, the boundaries between human and machine creativity will blur. The question shifts from whether machines can be curious to how human curiosity evolves in partnership with systems that approach problems differently than we do.\n\nThis points to a profound shift in how knowledge is created, validated, and distributed in a world where curiosity itself has been augmented beyond what we currently recognize. The ForesightCoach system that Bob and Jeremy developed demonstrates how static reports can become dynamic, interactive experiences – a small signal of much larger changes to come.	2025-03-22 04:01:23.684588+00	1	f	f

The Anglican Communion's struggle with the ordination of gay bishops represents a harbinger of these deeper theological ruptures that will characterize leadership challenges in the BANI world.\n\nWhen communities ask "Why hath God wroth this?" they are not merely seeking explanations for suffering but questioning the very nature of authority in a networked age. The traditional hierarchies that once provided clear answers are dissolving into distributed networks of competing certainties. This dissolution creates not just disagreement but ontological vertigo – a fundamental questioning of how we know what we claim to know.\n\nFuture leaders will navigate landscapes where competing revelations clash with unprecedented intensity. The Episcopal Church's experience demonstrates how even institutions founded on principles of inclusion can fracture when confronted with questions that touch the deepest wells of identity and belief. The "Book of Provocation" approach used by the Institute for the Future represents an early experiment in what will become essential: creating spaces where competing revelations can coexist long enough for dialogue to emerge.\n\nThe Indaba method employed at the Lambeth Conference offers a provocative model for what leadership might become – not driving toward resolution but orchestrating processes where multiple truths can be held simultaneously. This approach recognizes that in matters of profound belief, the goal cannot be consensus but rather a sacred holding of tension.\n\nAs digital technologies enable ever more specific belief communities to form and strengthen their internal narratives, leaders will need to develop what might be called "theological agility" – the capacity to move between competing cosmologies without dismissing any of them. This is not relativism but rather a recognition that in the BANI world, revelation itself has become distributed.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness will become increasingly dangerous as competing groups claim divine sanction for their positions. Leaders who can stand at this threshold without being consumed by it – maintaining clarity without succumbing to certainty – will become the essential mediators in a world where God's will is increasingly claimed by competing voices.	2025-03-22 04:12:10.57647+00	2	f	f

This ancient philosophical inquiry offers fresh perspectives for leaders navigating today's complex challenges.\n\nLife, viewed through a bio-engagement lens, represents complex, adaptive systems that maintain themselves through constant energy exchange with their environment. This perspective offers alternative frameworks for organizational thinking.\n\nThe book describes how Dr. Scott Dye, an orthopedist, had his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to better understand knee pain. This unconventional approach led him to reconceptualize knee pain not as a mechanical problem requiring mechanical solutions, but as a biological dilemma. Sometimes, his approach involves something as simple as applying frozen peas rather than surgical intervention. His shift from mechanical to biological thinking demonstrates how bio-engagement can transform professional practice.\n\nOrganizations might benefit from similar perspective shifts. The mechanical worldview—with its emphasis on control, prediction, and linear causality—could be complemented by biological thinking characterized by emergence, adaptation, and cyclical patterns.\n\nThe book mentions Virj Kan, who addresses purple sea urchin overpopulation along the California coast. Rather than treating this solely as an environmental problem, Kan engages with the entire ecosystem. By creating economic value from the urchins through biomaterials, she's working toward restoring balance to coastal kelp forests while developing sustainable business models.\n\nPolyface Farm offers another instructive example. Their principles—transparency, grass-based methods, individuality, mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health—aren't rigid rules but flexible guidelines that honor natural patterns while allowing for innovation.\n\nAs synthetic biology advances, possibly accelerated by generative AI, leaders might need deeper bio-engagement to navigate emerging questions about modifying and creating biological systems. Organizations could increasingly incorporate biological principles into their operations, potentially requiring leaders who can think in terms of ecosystems and cycles rather than solely linear processes.	2025-03-22 04:12:56.529134+00	1	f	f

This longitudinal perspective reveals how philanthropic approaches will evolve through distinct phases.\n\nIn the early phase (2025-2027), philanthropic organizations will primarily seek efficiency gains through technology adoption. Much like early GenAI applications focused on speed and automation, philanthropy will initially use digital tools to streamline grant processing, automate reporting, and scale existing programs. Organizations will put "something in the middle"—using digital platforms as mediating objects to facilitate dialogue between donors and recipients, but these interactions will remain relatively transactional.\n\nBy the middle phase (2028-2031), philanthropy will shift toward mind-stretching interactions rather than simple question-and-answer exchanges. Philanthropic leaders will engage in deeper conversations with both technology and communities, moving beyond automation toward augmentation of human capabilities. This mirrors the evolution from prompt-based interactions to more dynamic exchanges with GenAI. Constructive depolarization techniques will become essential as philanthropic organizations navigate increasingly divided communities, using technology to help translate between different worldviews—similar to how the Sisu.is app helps bridge communication gaps between different personality types.\n\nIn the mature phase (2032-2035), philanthropy will embrace human/agent swarms rather than relying on personal agents. Collaborative intelligence between philanthropists, communities, and technology will create new models of distributed decision-making. The bounce rope approach will replace rigid guardrails, allowing for flexible adaptation to emerging challenges while maintaining ethical boundaries. Philanthropic organizations will develop clarity stories rather than seeking certainty, acknowledging the BANI (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible) nature of global challenges.\n\nThroughout this evolution, reverse-mentoring will become increasingly valuable, with community members and younger generations guiding traditional philanthropic institutions through unfamiliar territory. The longitudinal view reveals that philanthropy's greatest challenge won't be technological adoption but developing the discernment to balance efficiency with effectiveness, automation with augmentation, and certainty with clarity.	2025-03-22 04:37:50.902016+00	2	f	f

By 2035, augmented leaders will need to develop what we call "algorithmic orchestration" - the ability to coordinate teams of both humans and AI agents toward common goals while navigating the jagged landscape of BANI.\n\nIn this future, leaders who maintain rigid certainty will fail spectacularly. As noted, "certainty is brittle, and brittle breaks badly." Instead, successful leaders will cultivate clarity while moderating certainty. They will say, "Here's what I understand clearly, and here's what remains unclear to me," demonstrating the strength-with-humility that the BANI world rewards.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness - where groups believe they are right and everyone else is wrong - will become increasingly dangerous in a digitally connected world. Extreme groups will use generative AI to amplify their messages and organize more effectively. Augmented leaders will need to develop advanced skills in constructive depolarization, using AI tools to identify common ground and redirect conflict energy toward dialogue.\n\nCross-cultural grace will become essential as leaders navigate increasingly diverse and polarized environments. The Consortium of Endowed Episcopal Parishes example demonstrates how even traditional institutions must develop skills to bridge divides. Future leaders will use AI systems to help translate not just language but cultural contexts and values, enhancing their ability to demonstrate "consideration and respect whether a person deserves it."\n\nThe futureback mindset will be crucial for navigating BANI conditions. Leaders will use advanced simulation tools to "plant a flag in the sands of time yet to come" and work backward to the present. These tools will help leaders balance the "provocation of ten-year forecasting with the wisdom of long-term cycles."\n\nIn the BANI future, leaders must be inclusive with full-spectrum thinking. They will use AI systems to help them resist binary choices and polarized thinking, instead embracing "gradients of possibility" that reveal opportunities hidden within chaos. The combination of human discernment and AI-augmented pattern recognition will allow leaders to find clarity without falling into the trap of brittle certainty.	2025-03-22 20:37:06.004877+00	3	f	f

Leaders will need to function effectively within systems they cannot fully understand, using their digital twins as exploratory probes into alternative realities.\n\nThe most effective augmented leaders will deliberately cultivate cognitive dissonance. They will maintain multiple, contradictory mental models simultaneously—not to resolve them, but to inhabit the productive tension between them. This goes beyond flexibility to a form of leadership quantum superposition, where decisions exist in multiple states until observation collapses them into action.\n\nDigital twin simulations will become leadership laboratories where leaders can explore the extremes of polarization. Rather than seeking middle ground, augmented leaders will use their digital twins to fully inhabit opposing worldviews. One person's freedom fighter may indeed be another's terrorist, and through immersive GenAI experiences, leaders will temporarily become both. This radical empathy—experiencing not just understanding different perspectives—creates a neuroplasticity that conventional depolarization techniques cannot match.\n\nThe bendable leader in a brittle world will deliberately induce controlled failure states. Just as stress testing reveals structural weaknesses in buildings, leaders will use GenAI to simulate catastrophic failures in their organizations, their strategies, and even their own leadership approaches. These simulated collapses become learning opportunities without real-world consequences.\n\nYoung gamers, already comfortable with nonlinear causality and incomprehensible rulesets, will bring valuable perspectives to leadership. Their ability to thrive in environments where the rules constantly change—and where winning often means discovering exploits the game designers never anticipated—makes them uniquely suited for BANI leadership. Their digital twins will interact with senior leaders' digital twins in simulated environments where conventional leadership wisdom deliberately fails.\n\nThe most powerful leadership skill will become what we might call "intentional hallucination"—the ability to see possibilities that don't yet exist and cannot be logically derived from current conditions. GenAI will help leaders cultivate this skill by generating scenarios that break conventional cause-and-effect relationships, training leaders to recognize patterns in chaos that others dismiss as noise.	2025-03-22 21:38:05.77878+00	2	f	f

By 2035, the most innovative leaders will operate as "curiosity conductors," orchestrating symphonies of human-AI collaboration that would seem like magic to today's executives.\n\nImagine a leadership workshop in 2035 where participants don't just brainstorm—they "curiosity storm." A senior executive thinks aloud about a supply chain challenge while her neural interface captures these musings. Instantly, a swarm of specialized AI agents generates dozens of potential solutions, each visualized in augmented reality around the room. Some solutions appear as floating 3D prototypes, others as animated system diagrams showing resource flows. The executive gestures toward three promising concepts, which immediately begin simulating outcomes across multiple scenarios.\n\nMeanwhile, across the globe, a "neo-traditionalist" leader conducts a different kind of workshop in a biophilic sanctuary. Here, participants deliberately disconnect from augmentation technology to engage in what they call "root thinking"—a practice that involves physical engagement with natural materials. They craft prototypes from clay, wood, and plant fibers, guided by ancient craft traditions but informed by biomimetic principles learned from their AI systems before disconnecting.\n\nBoth approaches exemplify what Winston Churchill meant when he described success as "the ability to go from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." The augmented leader fails hundreds of times in minutes, each iteration teaching the AI swarm to refine its understanding. The neo-traditionalist fails more slowly but with deeper embodied learning that no algorithm can replicate.\n\nThe most versatile leaders will move fluidly between these modes, recognizing that true innovation emerges from the creative tension between them. Like the Voyager system that taught itself to create a diamond sword in Minecraft with minimal direction, these leaders will set broad parameters for exploration rather than narrow objectives. They'll recognize, as the authors of "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" demonstrated, that the most revolutionary breakthroughs often come through circuitous, curiosity-driven paths rather than direct optimization.\n\nLeadership will become less about having the right answers and more about asking the most generative questions—questions that unlock what we might call "collaborative curiosity cascades" across human-machine networks.	2025-03-22 21:50:34.869312+00	2	f	f

This is not an abstract future; it is already unfolding in the choices leaders make today.\n\nConsider Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership model: unwavering in purpose yet tactically flexible. His clarity focused on human justice while his methods evolved with circumstances. Similarly, tomorrow's leaders must maintain their moral compass while navigating the choppy seas of a BANI world with AI as both sail and rudder.\n\nThe most profound challenge will not be technological adoption but spiritual discernment. As Bob experienced at Crozer Theological Seminary studying King's intellectual influences, leadership at its core involves a kind of faith—not blind certainty, but a compass that guides through doubt. GenAI will amplify this tension between clarity and faith, between precision and purpose.\n\nWhen a leader relies on AI clarity filters to separate signal from noise, who determines what constitutes "noise"? The ancient village elder served as a clarity filter, as do trusted advisors today. GenAI will assume this role, but with unprecedented scale and intimacy. The question becomes not whether to use these tools, but how to maintain human agency within them.\n\nYoung people crossing the threshold to adulthood will inherit leadership environments where the digital ecosystem shapes not just their careers but their very conception of purpose. Their leadership journey will not follow our linear paths but will emerge from the interplay between human calming and technological acceleration.\n\nThe shift from efficiency to effectiveness is not merely operational—it is existential. When leaders choose "effectiveness and calm" over "efficiency and speed," they are not simply optimizing processes; they are declaring what kind of world they wish to create. When they engage in "mind-stretching interactions" rather than "answer-finding," they are not just using AI differently; they are redefining the relationship between human and machine intelligence.\n\nThis is the profound choice before us: Will we use GenAI to re-enchant our world or merely to increase secular control? The answer lies not in the technology itself, but in how we choose to be augmented while remaining fully human.	2025-03-22 21:56:31.911492+00	2	f	f

In the BANI world, where certainty dissolves like morning mist, augmented futureback curiosity becomes the compass by which leaders navigate uncharted territories.\n\nImagine a leadership studio where generative AI serves as both canvas and paintbrush. Here, a CEO sketches twelve wildly divergent business models before breakfast, each one sprouting from a different "what if" question. By midday, three have collapsed spectacularly, teaching valuable lessons. By evening, one has morphed into something neither human nor machine could have conceived alone.\n\nThe Voyager system in Minecraft demonstrates this beautifully—an AI given the delightfully vague directive to "discover as many diverse things as possible" that taught itself to craft a diamond sword through autonomous exploration. This isn't just a game; it's a preview of how augmented curiosity will birth systems that wander, wonder, and create with minimal human oversight.\n\nConsider the vacuum tube's unlikely journey to computing. Thomas Edison invested in vacuum tubes for electrical currents, which were later refined for radio waves, which unexpectedly made them suitable for computers. No linear planning process would have connected these dots. Only curiosity—meandering, persistent, and gloriously inefficient—could have stumbled upon this connection.\n\nFuture leaders will embrace what we might call "beautiful failures"—prototypes that collapse in fascinating ways, revealing unexpected pathways. Churchill's ability to "go from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm" becomes not just admirable but essential. The leader's studio will hum with the energy of perpetual prototyping, where GenAI amplifies both the speed and diversity of iterations.\n\nThe maker movement has evolved from "Look what I can make!" to "Look what we can discover together." Fab Labs function less like workshops and more like curiosity incubators, where the boundaries between human creativity and machine intelligence blur into a productive dance.\n\nIn this landscape, the most valuable skill becomes not execution but discernment—the ability to recognize patterns across seemingly unrelated prototypes, to feel the subtle gravitational pull of an idea whose time has come, and to nurture it with the right balance of structure and freedom.	2025-03-22 21:56:54.571289+00	2	f	f

These ancient narratives contain signals of leadership patterns that will become increasingly relevant as we move toward augmented leadership.\n\nBy 2030, successful leaders will increasingly adopt what we might call "Odyssean navigation" between polarities. Just as Odysseus charted a course between Scylla and Charybdis, future leaders will use AI tools to map multiple pathways through seemingly impossible dilemmas. We're already seeing early signals of this in conflict resolution platforms that use natural language processing to identify common ground between opposing viewpoints. These tools will evolve into sophisticated "polarity mappers" that visualize the full spectrum of positions and help leaders find previously invisible paths forward.\n\nThe Daedalus principle will become central to dilemma flipping in the augmented era. When faced with the tower dilemma, Daedalus didn't solve the problem within its constraints—he reimagined the constraints entirely. By 2028, we anticipate leadership teams using generative AI to systematically challenge assumed constraints in strategic planning. These "constraint-busting sessions" will become standard practice, with AI systems trained to identify hidden assumptions and generate radical alternatives that human teams might overlook due to cognitive biases.\n\nThe Oracle at Delphi model points to how the leader-AI relationship will evolve. The Oracle never provided direct answers but ambiguous prophecies requiring interpretation. Similarly, the most effective AI augmentation won't replace leadership judgment but will enhance it through provocative, sometimes deliberately ambiguous inputs. We're tracking early signals of this in experimental AI systems designed to increase cognitive flexibility rather than simply providing answers.\n\nPrometheus's gift of fire—bringing both progress and punishment—signals the ethical dimensions of AI augmentation that leaders must navigate. By 2027, we expect to see the emergence of "ethical augmentation frameworks" that help leaders anticipate the second and third-order consequences of AI-augmented decisions.\n\nThe template "I want help _________, in order to _________" will evolve into more sophisticated frameworks for human-AI collaboration. Future leaders might specify: "I want help identifying the Scylla and Charybdis in this strategic decision, in order to chart an Odyssean path between them" or "I want help applying Daedalus thinking to reimagine the constraints of this market challenge."\n\nThese mythological frameworks aren't just metaphors but practical models for how leadership will evolve in the augmented era. Organizations that recognize and apply these patterns early will develop significant advantages in navigating the increasingly complex leadership landscape of the next decade.	2025-03-22 22:05:26.097646+00	1	f	f

This specialized position connects directly to the maker instinct that drives innovation in uncertain times. Like the ForesightCoach system that Bob and Jeremy developed in 2022—which began as a simple experiment to let people "Talk to Office Shock" and unexpectedly evolved into a rich interactive tool—vintage technology repair combines practical skills with exploratory learning.\n\nIn university settings, vintage technology repairers will use generative AI to help diagnose and fix legacy systems. This represents augmented futureback curiosity in action: combining historical knowledge with future-oriented tools. The repairer might use AI to generate multiple repair approaches for systems that predate current security protocols, revealing vulnerabilities that persist across technological generations.\n\nThis approach mirrors what NVIDIA demonstrated with the Voyager system, which autonomously explored Minecraft with minimal direction, teaching itself complex skills like creating a diamond sword. Vintage technology repairers will similarly deploy autonomous agents to explore legacy systems, identifying patterns and solutions that might not be apparent through direct programming.\n\nThe repair process itself embodies rapid prototyping—quick cycles of try, learn, and try again. When working with obsolete hardware or deprecated software, repairers will generate multiple potential solutions, test them quickly, and learn from each failure. This curiosity-driven approach accepts that, as Churchill noted, success often requires going "from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."\n\nUniversities might establish dedicated spaces where students can experience this hands-on approach to technological understanding. These environments would complement the secure computing infrastructures described earlier, providing practical experience with the physical components underlying digital systems. Students might practice defending against attacks on vintage systems before confronting current threats, similar to Campbell's war gaming approach at the Army War College.\n\nThe vintage technology repairer's work exemplifies what Kentaro Toyama identifies as the three pillars of wisdom in technology implementation: intention, discernment, and self-control. Rather than pursuing constant replacement, repairers carefully evaluate what's worth preserving and what can be learned from technological evolution. This selective approach will become increasingly valuable as ambient computing makes technology less visible and more integrated into campus environments.	2025-04-08 00:08:18.211842+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/87b9246a-b8a9-413a-86c1-fe7c9162824f.jpg

This role's evolution parallels what we'll see across all professions in the coming decade—careers becoming more fluid, adaptive, and experimental. Just as repairers must continuously learn new approaches to old technologies, professionals in all fields will need to develop comfort with ongoing reinvention.\n\nFluid careers will operate like perpetual rapid prototyping experiments. Consider IDEO's development process for the PalmPilot, where approximately one hundred versions evolved from crude foam cutouts to machine-shop prototypes to commercial products. Each iteration revealed lessons that informed the next. Similarly, professionals will cycle through multiple versions of their careers, with each role providing insights that shape future directions.\n\nIn this brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (BANI) world, career planning will follow the military's "one-third, two-thirds" principle—but inverted. Rather than spending one-third of time planning and two-thirds preparing, professionals will minimize advance planning in favor of learn-as-you-go experimentation. The emphasis will be on developing capabilities that can be applied across contexts rather than mastering a single domain.\n\nGenerative AI will enable this experimentation by allowing professionals to rapidly prototype potential career directions. A marketing specialist might use AI to generate sample work products for adjacent fields like user experience design or content strategy, testing their aptitude before committing to formal retraining. This mirrors how ForesightCoach evolved from a simple demonstration to a sophisticated interactive tool through continuous experimentation.\n\nOrganizations will create environments that support this fluidity. Much like IDEO's studios—where one design group purchased the tailpiece from an old DC-3 aircraft and another acquired heavy curtains from a closing theater—companies will develop spaces where employees can experiment with new roles in low-risk settings. These career laboratories will function similarly to Fab Labs, which MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms developed as incubators for innovation beyond tools.\n\nThe most successful professionals will approach their careers with what Mark Frauenfelder, former editor of Make Magazine, identified as the maker's secret: absence of fear of failure. They'll recognize that, as Winston Churchill observed, success often requires going "from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." Their career paths may appear circuitous—like how vacuum tubes, initially developed for electrical currents and later refined for radio waves, unexpectedly enabled computing—but will ultimately lead to innovations that couldn't have been planned directly.	2025-04-08 00:09:26.823488+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/382aa13c-b918-475c-b951-3dead40993f4.jpg

By 2034, leaders will need clearer frameworks for engaging with biological systems as generative AI accelerates developments in synthetic biology.\n\nDr. Scott Dye demonstrated this biological thinking when he had his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic. This experience led him to approach knee pain not as a mechanical problem requiring mechanical solutions, but as a biological condition requiring biological approaches. His patients now often receive simple treatments like a bag of frozen peas rather than immediate surgical intervention.\n\nThis shift from mechanical to biological thinking will extend beyond medicine. The economic intersection of biology, life sciences, and digital media will create new opportunities for leaders who can think in biological rather than mechanical terms.\n\nVirj Kan exemplifies this approach in her work with purple sea urchins along the California coast. After the decline of the urchins' natural predators around 2015, their population exploded, decimating coastal kelp forests. Rather than viewing the urchins simply as pests, Kan's company, Primitives Biodesign, creates economically valuable products from their shells. She regularly conducts urchin culling dives and works with local fishermen to understand the entire ecosystem. Her success depends on both financial outcomes and supporting natural systems.\n\nThe Salatin family's Polyface Farm offers another model of bio-engagement. Their principles include transparency (allowing visitors anytime), grass-based agriculture (moving livestock frequently to new "salad bars"), respecting the individuality of plants and animals, mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health through earthworm enhancement. These principles guide their farming practices while allowing flexibility in execution.\n\nBy 2034, organizations will increasingly adopt biological rather than mechanical metaphors. Leaders will need to recognize that life functions as a complex, adaptive system that maintains itself through constant energy exchange with its environment. Those who can apply these patterns to organizational challenges will navigate uncertainty more effectively than those who remain locked in mechanical thinking.	2025-03-22 22:07:57.623762+00	1	f	f

Digital twins of historical figures could interact with each other in simulated environments, allowing leaders to experience multiple perspectives on how economic inequality, competing ideologies, and social tensions created conditions where dialogue collapsed.\n\nThese simulations would go beyond traditional historical analysis by creating immersive experiences where leaders can observe how certainty hardened into conflict. The brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (BANI) qualities that characterize our current era were also present during major historical transitions, though in different forms.\n\nLeaders using these historical simulations would develop cross-cultural grace across time periods, not just across contemporary cultures. They would see how the "threshold of righteousness" - where groups become absolutely certain they are right and others are wrong - manifested in historical contexts. This understanding would help them recognize similar patterns in current conflicts before they reach breaking points.\n\nSmart mob swarms have historical precedents, but future versions augmented by AI will operate differently. Historical simulations could reveal how previous movements organized and mobilized, providing insights for constructive depolarization in contemporary settings.\n\nThe maker instinct could drive the creation of these historical learning environments. Using rapid prototyping approaches, teams could develop simulations that allow leaders to test different engagement strategies with polarized historical groups. These prototypes would prioritize learning in the field rather than through advance planning, with quick cycles of try, learn, and try again.\n\nBy 2035, leadership development will routinely include these immersive historical experiences. Leaders will practice depolarization skills in simulated historical contexts before applying them to present challenges. This approach will help them maintain clarity about what they know while avoiding the dangerous certainty that has repeatedly led to conflict throughout human history.	2025-03-24 18:07:13.704452+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ce0298ed-03af-4ca0-a819-1d008acd6951.jpg

The concept of "putting something in the middle" described by Palus and Drath can be enhanced through structured approaches to conflict resolution that prioritize collective understanding over individual perspectives.\n\nIn organizations facing BANI conditions, leaders might adopt a more centralized decision-making framework while still encouraging broad participation. GenAI tools could facilitate this balance by creating structured dialogue spaces where competing viewpoints are systematically analyzed rather than merely accommodated. The goal becomes not just depolarization for its own sake, but depolarization in service of organizational coherence and decisive action.\n\nThis approach transforms the "winning proposition" concept Pietersen describes into something more akin to a central organizing principle. Leaders would use GenAI not just to craft compelling statements but to ensure these principles permeate all levels of the organization with consistent interpretation. The clarity filter becomes more deliberate, distinguishing between productive and unproductive contradictions within the organization.\n\nCommander's intent and flexive intent concepts gain new dimensions in this framework. Leaders maintain unwavering clarity about organizational objectives while allowing for adaptable implementation methods. GenAI tools would help monitor how well local decisions align with central directives, identifying when tactical flexibility has drifted too far from strategic intent.\n\nDigital twins in this context would function as organizational simulacra, testing theoretical positions against practical conditions before implementation. Rather than merely predicting conflicts, these tools would help leaders analyze the structural nature of conflicts and determine appropriate systematic responses.\n\nThe BANI future's brittleness requires not just individual resilience but organizational discipline. Leaders must develop what might be called "concrete analysis of concrete conditions," using GenAI to penetrate surface appearances and understand underlying organizational contradictions.\n\nThis vision of augmented leadership emphasizes collective discipline alongside individual empowerment. It recognizes that in highly polarized environments, constructive depolarization sometimes requires more structure, not less—creating clarity through disciplined analysis rather than hoping it emerges organically from dialogue alone.	2025-03-24 18:08:31.329153+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/72556ac9-e1c7-447e-9577-488301106e65.jpg

When researchers approach HIV treatment from a biological rather than mechanical perspective, they begin to see beyond the simple delivery of antiretrovirals to understanding how these compounds integrate with the body's systems over extended periods.\n\nConsider how Scott Jenkins transformed the Seattle Mariners' stadium operations by encouraging staff to treat the ballpark as their own home. Similarly, HIV researchers who develop bio-empathy for patients might design treatments that work with the body's natural rhythms rather than imposing artificial schedules. This shift in perspective could lead to medications that release compounds in harmony with the body's metabolic cycles, potentially reducing side effects while maintaining efficacy.\n\nThe immersive learning approaches described in IFTF's work suggest possibilities for HIV research teams. Researchers might benefit from experiences that simulate aspects of living with HIV and current treatment regimens. Such firsthand exposure, while limited compared to actual patient experience, could generate insights about treatment burden that pure data analysis might miss.\n\nAs generative AI expands into biological applications over the next decade, HIV treatment research could benefit from the same algorithms that are beginning to solve complex biological problems like protein folding. These tools might help identify novel delivery mechanisms for long-acting medications by analyzing patterns in human biology that have previously been overlooked.\n\nThe polarities between medical intervention and natural bodily processes present a dilemma that cannot be solved but might be improved. Long-acting medications could represent a middle path that respects both the need for pharmaceutical intervention and the body's own systems.\n\nBy 2034, as more companies incorporate biological principles into their work, HIV treatment might exemplify this bio-engagement approach. Treatment regimens might shift from imposing external control to supporting the body's existing immune functions, perhaps through medications that adapt to individual biological patterns rather than requiring the person to adapt to medication schedules.	2025-03-24 18:14:46.901492+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a986ada5-3b3a-482a-a287-4fc8ec9dcb5e.jpg

As GenAI systems evolve, they will help leaders craft poetic expressions that distill complex ideas into their essence. This isn't about using AI to generate corporate slogans, but rather about engaging in a collaborative process that stretches a leader's thinking beyond conventional business language.\n\nWhen leaders face a world characterized by brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility (what the book calls the "BANI" world), poetry can help them see through contradictions to discern direction. Poetry embraces paradox while still communicating clearly—a skill increasingly valuable as complexity grows.\n\nConsider how Bob uses his AI assistant "Stretch" to find "more evocative words or phrases" when writing. This practice helps him develop what the book describes as "amplified clarity"—a resilient story of direction combined with flexibility in how change might occur. Leaders might develop similar practices, using GenAI to explore metaphors that make strategic challenges more accessible without oversimplifying them.\n\nLooking ahead from the present to possible futures (what the book calls "thinking futureback"), poetry may become part of how leaders re-enchant their organizations. David Rose's "Ladder of Enchantment" suggests that adding narrative significance creates emotional resonance. Poetry naturally does this, helping leaders move beyond secular control toward meaning-making that connects people to purpose.\n\nLeaders might expand their "I want help... in order to..." templates to include poetic exploration: "I want help finding metaphors for our strategic challenges, in order to communicate direction without false certainty." This approach aligns with the book's distinction between clarity (an open book) and certainty (a closed fist)—poetry opens possibilities rather than closing them.\n\nBy 2030, the most effective leaders may regularly engage with poetry through GenAI not just to communicate better, but to think better—seeing patterns and possibilities that linear prose might miss.	2025-03-24 18:43:54.981427+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a5e32f28-4931-4946-8134-ce6a2283637c.jpg

Leaders who understand life not as a mechanical process but as an interconnected biological system will have distinct advantages in navigating complexity. As Scott Jenkins demonstrated at the Seattle Mariners' stadium, life-centered leadership means recognizing that human systems exist within natural ones, not separate from them.\n\nJenkins' approach to stadium management exemplifies this understanding. Rather than viewing environmental sustainability as a constraint, he saw it as an opportunity to enhance the family experience. By implementing real-time feedback systems that showed energy usage and rewarding conservation, he created a culture where team members actively participated in reducing environmental impact. His personal choices—biking to work, driving hybrid vehicles efficiently, and picking up litter—modeled the behaviors he expected from others.\n\nThe Eastgate Centre in Harare, Zimbabwe offers another powerful example of bio-engagement, using termite mound airflow principles to regulate temperature without conventional heating or air conditioning. This approach doesn't fight against natural systems but works within them, recognizing that if humans compete with nature, "nature will win in the long run."\n\nBy 2034, leaders will need to shift from seeing life through a mechanistic lens to understanding it as a complex adaptive system. This perspective will require moving beyond efficiency and speed toward effectiveness and calm, as outlined in the futureback view. The most successful organizations will be those that can maintain clarity of purpose while embracing the inherent uncertainty of biological systems.\n\nThis bio-engaged concept of life will extend beyond environmental considerations to how we structure organizations themselves. Rather than rigid hierarchies designed for control, organizations will increasingly resemble living ecosystems—adaptive, resilient, and capable of self-organization. Leaders who can foster these qualities while maintaining strategic direction will thrive in environments where traditional command-and-control approaches fail.\n\nThe future of leadership lies not in dominating life systems but in understanding, respecting, and working within them—recognizing that our human endeavors are ultimately part of something larger than ourselves.	2025-03-25 08:52:02.695497+00	2	f	f

As we look toward 2035, the integration of canine companions into leadership practices may evolve beyond their current roles. While digital agents will execute complex tasks through APIs and computer interfaces, dogs already demonstrate a form of agency through their ability to perform tasks based on general instructions rather than constant micromanagement.\n\nThe signals of this development are emerging in research on cognitive and emotional benefits of human-animal interaction. Studies indicate that interaction with dogs stimulates different neural pathways than digital interfaces, potentially enhancing creative thinking and emotional intelligence in ways that complement digital augmentation.\n\nFuture leaders may find themselves navigating a dilemma between high-tech and high-touch forms of augmentation. This presents an opportunity for dilemma flipping: rather than choosing between digital precision and biological intuition, leaders might orchestrate both simultaneously. Just as the duck-rabbit illusion challenges us to perceive multiple realities at once, leaders will need to hold seemingly contradictory augmentation approaches in mind.\n\nBy 2030, we may see specialized canine training programs designed specifically for executive environments, where dogs are not merely comfort animals but biological agents in the dilemma-flipping process. These programs would leverage the dog's natural abilities to detect subtle emotional cues that even advanced AI might miss, creating a multi-layered augmentation strategy.\n\nThis approach reminds us that augmentation extends beyond digital tools. The direction of change suggests that leadership enhancement will become increasingly hybrid, combining digital, biological, and social elements. Leaders who can effectively coordinate these diverse forms of augmentation will likely develop superior capabilities for navigating the BANI world and flipping seemingly intractable dilemmas into opportunities.	2025-03-26 16:59:10.444151+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/698b8f7a-22d4-4130-8f7c-17d6cdfc6df9.jpg

These agents align with what David Rose described as "enchanted objects" - ordinary things that do extraordinary things through AI capabilities. In the next decade, we will likely see more AI agents that deliberately incorporate non-utilitarian characteristics to create emotional connections with humans.\n\nThis development connects to our earlier discussion of hallucinations and meaning-making. When GenAI systems incorporate playful personas, they signal their limitations in ways that humans find more acceptable. Rather than presenting fabrications as facts, these personality-driven agents frame their outputs as creative contributions, which can be valuable when labeled appropriately for exploratory exercises.\n\nFor leaders navigating the BANI future, cat bois and similar agent designs offer practical advantages. They fail more gracefully at the edge of their expertise by using humor or self-awareness to acknowledge limitations. This approach addresses the concern raised earlier that "most of today's GenAI systems do not yet fail gracefully."\n\nAs organizations deploy swarms of agents and humans working together, the design of agent personalities will become a strategic consideration. Leaders will need to determine when efficiency-focused agents are appropriate versus when relationship-building agents might better serve organizational needs. This is particularly relevant when considering how agents will interact with applications and sensitive information.\n\nThe re-enchantment concept discussed earlier applies directly here. In our increasingly secular world, these personality-driven agents may help bridge the gap between purely utilitarian technology and the human desire for meaning and connection. This represents one way GenAI might help "re-enchant our world" as mentioned in the background material.\n\nFor augmented leaders, understanding how to deploy the right type of agent for specific contexts will become an essential skill, particularly as agents gain the ability to perform domains of tasks that previously made up entire human jobs.	2025-03-26 17:01:09.594888+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/192a612c-e154-42f6-9d87-00a5287a4fdc.jpg

Just as different colors combine to create something new, leaders will need to blend human and AI capabilities in what we might call "convergent leadership."\n\nIn the BANI future, leaders who maintain clarity about purpose while exploring unexpected connections will thrive. Dr. King demonstrated this approach decades ago by connecting civil rights with environmental justice and anti-war activism. His clarity about human justice remained constant, but his tactical approaches evolved as he recognized patterns across seemingly separate domains.\n\nGenerative AI will enhance this pattern recognition in several practical ways:\n\n• When facing polarized viewpoints, GenAI can identify potential common ground by analyzing communication patterns and suggesting alternative framings that might resonate with both sides.\n\n• Digital twins will allow leaders to test different approaches to complex problems before implementing them, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.\n\n• Smart mob swarms will organize more effectively when GenAI helps visualize emerging patterns that humans might otherwise miss.\n\nThe risks are substantial. Without proper human guidance, these systems could amplify existing biases or create misleading patterns. The "know you know" feeling that neurologist Robert Burton identified—where certainty feels like knowledge even when it isn't—could be artificially strengthened by compelling but inaccurate AI syntheses.\n\nLeaders must therefore develop the ability to distinguish between genuine insights and artificial hallucinations. This requires maintaining clarity without falling into certainty, a distinction the background insights emphasize repeatedly.\n\nBy combining human judgment with AI analysis, leaders can navigate the complex landscape of the BANI future more effectively than either could alone. The key is to remain grounded in observable signals of change while exploring new connections that might not be immediately obvious.	2025-04-06 15:47:26.831136+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/97b93c5f-945c-4696-b10c-89279454e6e9.jpg

Leaders will develop working relationships with their AI tools that reflect their personal leadership styles. Some may use AI primarily for information processing, while others might engage it as a thought partner for strategic decisions. As one IFTF executive noted, "The tools themselves will fade into the background as leaders focus on the uniquely human aspects of their work."\n\nThe daily experience of leadership will shift as routine tasks become automated. Leaders who previously spent hours on information synthesis may redirect that time toward human connection and ethical discernment. This shift mirrors what happened at IDEO, where David Kelley found that futureback thinking helped his team avoid building "great products that never should have been built in the first place." Similarly, augmented leaders will use AI to test assumptions before committing resources.\n\nWe're already seeing signals of this change. Several Fortune 500 companies have created "AI co-pilot" programs for their executive teams, allowing leaders to experiment with different approaches to human-AI collaboration. These early experiments reveal that the most effective leaders maintain clear boundaries around when to rely on AI versus human judgment.\n\nThe career development of augmented leaders may become less linear. Like Ellen Galinsky's reframing of work-life balance as "navigation," leadership development will become an ongoing process of navigating between human wisdom and technological capability. Leaders might cycle through periods of intensive AI learning followed by application and reflection.\n\nThe dilemma of strength with humility will become more pronounced. Leaders will need to demonstrate competence with new technologies while acknowledging the limitations of both AI and their own understanding. This echoes the certification revolution described by Michael Conroy, where transparency becomes both an opportunity and a challenge for leaders.\n\nFor some leaders, the human calming skill will become essential as they create space for reflection amid constant technological stimulation. This skill will help them maintain the clarity of intention needed to lead effectively in a BANI world.	2025-04-03 18:24:49.287426+00	1	f	f

Leaders on the global stage will face increasingly complex polarities that transcend traditional nation-state dynamics, with non-state actors, multinational corporations, and digital communities wielding unprecedented influence.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness that characterizes extreme fundamentalist groups will become more pronounced in international relations. We're already seeing signals of this in how some nations frame their geopolitical positions as moral imperatives rather than strategic interests. Augmented leaders will need to resist the pull toward absolute certainty in their diplomatic approaches, maintaining clarity about what they know while acknowledging the limits of their understanding.\n\nCross-cultural grace, as described by anthropologist Edward T. Hall, will become an essential leadership capability. Future diplomatic leaders will need to navigate not just differences between nations but also the jagged landscape of subcultures within nations. The silent language of culture will be increasingly complex as digital technologies enable dispersed cultural groups to maintain cohesion across borders.\n\nConsider how the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops attempted to navigate polarized views. This approach of bringing opposing viewpoints together for thoughtful conversation, rather than judgment, offers a model for international diplomacy in a BANI world. Similarly, the faith-based diplomacy approach that incorporates religious representatives in conflict resolution may become more prevalent as traditional secular diplomacy struggles with deeply held cultural and religious differences.\n\nThe military strategy professors at the US Army War College who exchanged PowerPoint presentations demonstrate how different domains can learn from each other. Future geopolitical leaders will need to blend approaches from business, military, faith communities, and civil society to address complex global challenges.\n\nAs with the young soldier in Iraq who went door-to-door discussing democracy while reading the Quran, tomorrow's diplomatic leaders will need to combine technological sophistication with deep cultural understanding. Their AI systems may process vast amounts of geopolitical data, but the human capacity to build trust across profound differences will remain irreplaceable in constructively depolarizing international conflicts.	2025-04-03 19:05:55.293418+00	1	f	f

Just as Virj Kan works with the natural cycles of kelp forests and sea urchins, future leaders must understand the natural cycles of human behavior, motivation, and social dynamics. The BANI world demands that we see human systems as living ecosystems rather than mechanical structures to be optimized.\n\nLeaders who mistake human dilemmas for human problems will face the same pitfalls as those who misunderstand environmental challenges. Consider how the Salatin family at Polyface Farm honors the "pigness of the pig" by creating conditions where animals can express their natural behaviors. Similarly, augmented leaders will need to honor the "humanness of humans" by designing organizations that work with rather than against fundamental human tendencies.\n\nGenerative AI will help leaders map the complex patterns of human behavior, just as it can help map environmental systems. However, the augmented leader must avoid the trap of reducing human complexity to algorithmic simplicity. The principles that guide Polyface Farm—transparency, individuality, and mimicking natural patterns—offer a template for how leaders might approach human systems as well.\n\nThe immersion phase of dilemma flipping becomes particularly important when dealing with human nature. Leaders must resist the urge to judge too quickly or decide too late when facing the contradictions inherent in human systems. For example, humans simultaneously crave both security and freedom, both individual recognition and community belonging. These are not problems to solve but dilemmas to navigate.\n\nBio-engagement with human nature will require leaders to develop what might be called "social ecology"—the ability to see human organizations as living systems with their own natural cycles of growth, stability, creative destruction, and renewal. Just as Virj Kan spends time diving with urchins and embedding with local fishermen, future leaders will need to immerse themselves in the lived experiences of their people rather than relying solely on data and abstractions.\n\nThe augmented leader's toolkit will include AI systems that can help identify patterns in human behavior that might otherwise remain invisible, but the wisdom to work with these patterns rather than against them will remain a distinctly human capability.	2025-04-03 19:13:53.298764+00	2	f	f

Ellen Galinsky's work on work-life navigation provides a framework for understanding how these biological realities can be integrated into workplace structures. Just as Galinsky approaches work-life issues with a strong yet humble style—engaged and open without overselling—future leaders will need to address family formation with similar transparency.\n\nThe principles that Scott Jenkins applied at T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field) demonstrate how feedback systems can connect daily actions to larger goals. Jenkins created systems that showed staff how much energy they were using and rewarded energy-saving behaviors. Similarly, workplaces might develop systems that acknowledge the biological realities of reproduction and parenting while providing real-time support. On-site childcare facilities could incorporate natural elements and developmental patterns, much as Jenkins incorporated environmental sustainability into stadium operations.\n\nDr. Scott Dye, the orthopedist who had his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to understand knee pain, exemplifies the kind of firsthand experience that builds empathy. His approach to knee pain as a biological rather than mechanical issue parallels how organizations might view childcare—not as a logistical problem to be solved but as a biological reality requiring empathy and support.\n\nPolyface Farms demonstrates bio-engagement through agricultural practices that work with natural cycles. This same principle could apply to fertility and childcare policies that acknowledge human reproductive cycles and developmental stages rather than expecting employees to conform to rigid workplace structures.\n\nGenerative AI tools will enable modeling of biological systems, potentially improving fertility treatments. However, as noted in the McKinsey report cited in the background material, the energy demands of AI systems—expected to reach 35 gigawatts by 2030 in the US alone—present environmental challenges that must be addressed.\n\nBy viewing human reproduction and development through the lens of bio-engagement, organizations will create more resilient systems that recognize, as the bio-engagement skill checklist suggests, the interconnectedness of natural patterns and workplace practices.	2025-04-03 23:56:26.565029+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e65e03f2-2689-4dca-bc4d-7b70409aa12b.jpg

When faced with uncertainty, many leaders default to what Henry Kissinger observed as the typical American approach: treating challenges as engineering puzzles with clear solutions rather than dilemmas requiring nuanced responses. This rush to resolution can be catastrophic in complex environments.\n\nA particularly damaging leadership mistake is failing to engage in dilemma flipping. Consider a military leader who, unlike General Patton, sees being surrounded by enemy forces only as a hopeless situation rather than a potential opportunity. Where Patton recognized that the Germans had thinned their resources by surrounding Allied forces—creating an opening for breakthrough—less effective leaders remain trapped in a single perspective, unable to see alternative possibilities.\n\nLeaders who insist on perfect planning before action often make disastrous decisions in rapidly changing environments. The military's "one-third, two-thirds" rule suggests spending one-third of time planning and two-thirds preparing in the field, but poor leaders frequently invert this ratio. They become paralyzed by analysis, spending excessive time planning while the situation evolves beyond their understanding. In contrast, rapid prototyping—as practiced by design firm IDEO—embraces a learn-as-you-go approach that minimizes planning in favor of iterative learning.\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous leadership failure is the abandonment of futureback curiosity. When leaders focus exclusively on immediate problems without considering long-term implications, they risk building "great products that never should have been built in the first place," as David Kelley of IDEO noted. Without foresight informing their decisions, leaders solve yesterday's problems while missing tomorrow's opportunities.\n\nIn times of great uncertainty, leaders who lose their maker instinct become passive observers rather than active shapers of the future. This passivity in the face of complexity represents a profound leadership failure. The worst decisions often come not from action but inaction—from leaders who, overwhelmed by the BANI world, retreat into analysis paralysis rather than embracing the iterative, curious, dilemma-flipping mindset that complex challenges demand.	2025-04-04 14:32:27.738201+00	3	f	f

As Ellen Galinsky's work on work-life navigation suggests, there are both fixed obstacles and fluid currents in balancing professional responsibilities with family care. Organizations that approach child care with quiet transparency rather than self-promotion will likely build more trust and resilience.\n\nWhen British Petroleum rebranded as BP ("Beyond Petroleum") and promoted its environmental initiatives, it became a target for criticism, especially after the Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion. Similarly, organizations that loudly advertise their child care benefits without substantive support may find themselves vulnerable to backlash. Instead, leaders should implement meaningful child care solutions while allowing third parties to notice and spread the word about these initiatives.\n\nThe "amazing power in vulnerability" identified by the Center for Creative Leadership applies directly to child care policies. Leaders who acknowledge the challenges of parenting and demonstrate genuine understanding will connect more authentically with employees navigating work-life integration. Those who pretend to "fly above it all" risk being labeled "out of touch, clueless, cold and heartless, and disingenuous."\n\nGenerative AI can enhance child care support through improved perspective-taking, helping leaders understand the diverse needs of parents and caregivers. Advanced decision support systems can analyze data on child development, care options, and employee needs to inform policy decisions. Automated administrative tasks can streamline child care enrollment, subsidy applications, and scheduling, allowing human resources professionals to focus on more complex family support issues.\n\nAs noted in the background insights, "Children keep us humble, especially those of us who are parents." This humility is essential for leaders developing child care policies. By approaching child care with strength and humility rather than self-promotion, organizations can create environments where both parents and non-parents feel supported and valued.\n\nIn the future workplace, the most effective child care initiatives will be those implemented with quiet competence, transparent in their operations but not self-congratulatory in their messaging. These programs will acknowledge the vulnerability inherent in parenting while providing robust support systems that enhance both professional productivity and family well-being.	2025-04-04 14:41:14.551981+00	2	f	f

Virj Kan's company, Primitives Biodesign, demonstrates how economic incentives can align with ecological restoration. Her work with purple sea urchins—creating valuable products from these creatures that have decimated kelp forests along the California coast—shows how business models can address ecological imbalances while creating economic value.\n\nThe Salatin family's approach at Polyface Farm offers insights for food production at scale. Their farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley operates on principles including transparency (welcoming visitors anytime), grass-based production (moving livestock frequently to new "salad bars"), honoring the individuality of plants and animals (respecting the "pigness" of the pig), mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health (focusing on earthworm enhancement). These principles provide clear direction while allowing flexible execution.\n\nGenAI tools will help agricultural leaders visualize ecological relationships that remain invisible to the human eye. These tools might map soil microbiome interactions, track nutrient flows through ecosystems, or model how different farming practices affect carbon sequestration over decades.\n\nLeaders will increasingly recognize that feeding a country presents a dilemma rather than a problem. Like Scott Jenkins at the Seattle Mariners' stadium who implemented feedback systems showing energy usage and rewarded conservation, food system leaders will need to establish metrics that connect consumers with the ecological impacts of their food choices.\n\nThe commons creating skill will become essential as agricultural leaders develop shared assets that benefit multiple stakeholders. Just as the Svalbard International Seed Vault preserves crop diversity as a global commons, new agricultural commons might include watershed management systems, pollinator corridors across property lines, or regional composting networks that turn "waste" into soil-building resources.\n\nThese approaches will require leaders who can see beyond today's competitive landscape to tomorrow's collaborative possibilities—leaders who can make common cause with others while still allowing competition to occur at a higher level.	2025-04-04 14:45:53.073357+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/96ec1406-848e-4df1-b923-77a6ded13881.jpg

For millennia, humans have moved from hunter-gatherers to settled farmers, developing increasingly sophisticated methods of food production that both shaped and were shaped by the natural world.\n\nEarly agricultural practices often mimicked natural systems out of necessity. The three sisters planting method—growing corn, beans, and squash together—developed by indigenous peoples of North America exemplifies early bio-empathy. The corn provided structure for beans to climb, beans fixed nitrogen in the soil, and squash's broad leaves suppressed weeds and retained soil moisture. This polyculture approach, similar to what the Salatin family practices at Polyface Farm, worked with nature's patterns rather than against them.\n\nThe industrial revolution fundamentally altered this relationship, introducing mechanization and later chemical inputs that dramatically increased yields but often at the expense of soil health and biodiversity. The Green Revolution of the mid-20th century further intensified production through high-yielding crop varieties, irrigation, and synthetic fertilizers, feeding billions but creating new ecological challenges.\n\nToday's agricultural commons are under threat. The Svalbard International Seed Vault represents a modern attempt to preserve agricultural biodiversity as a shared asset for humanity, storing millions of seed varieties at minus 18 degrees centigrade near the North Pole. This facility, supported by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and Norwegian government, embodies commons creating at a global scale.\n\nLeaders like Virj Kan at Primitives Biodesign demonstrate how future agricultural systems might function. Just as she creates economic value from invasive purple sea urchins while restoring kelp forests, tomorrow's agricultural leaders will develop business models that align economic incentives with ecological restoration.\n\nThe principles that guide Polyface Farm—transparency, grass-based production, honoring individuality, mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health—offer a template for agricultural commons creating. These principles provide clear direction while allowing flexible execution, enabling farmers to adapt to local conditions while contributing to larger ecological health.\n\nAs we move forward, agricultural leaders will increasingly recognize that feeding populations isn't merely about maximizing production but about creating resilient systems that regenerate rather than deplete the commons upon which all food production depends.	2025-04-04 14:50:17.818841+00	2	f	f

David Rose, an MIT computer scientist mentioned in the book, coined the term "enchanted objects" to describe how AI allows ordinary objects to do extraordinary things—like umbrellas that light up when rain is forecasted or pill bottles that remind you to take medication. These objects will become commonplace, responding to needs before we articulate them.\n\nThe distinction between physical and digital reality will continue to blur. Your coffee cup might adjust its temperature based on your preferences, while your workspace reconfigures itself as you transition between tasks. This reflects what the book describes as "calm technologies" that inform and enhance without taking center stage.\n\nGenAI may help us explore the mysteries of existence and consciousness. As the book notes, while GenAI has come of age in an increasingly secular world, it might help us explore the invisible as well as the visible, potentially re-enchanting our world rather than furthering secularization.\n\nOrganizations will adopt what the book calls "shape-shifting" characteristics, constantly adapting to market changes. Communities will form and dissolve around specific purposes, enabled by AI systems that match complementary skills with precision. This connects to the concept of "augmented smart mob swarming" described in the book—the ability to create and nurture purposeful networks through intelligent use of digital media and ecosystems of humans and digital agents.\n\nDaily life will require new forms of literacy. As suggested in the book, the template "I want help _________, in order to _________" will guide how people specify how they want to be amplified and augmented by their digital tools.\n\nPeople who maintain calm and purpose amid possibilities will excel. This connects to the book's contrast between "present-forward" and "futureback" views of GenAI, where effectiveness and calm are valued over mere efficiency and speed, and meaning-making is prioritized over avoiding AI hallucinations.	2025-04-04 14:57:04.139131+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/b0b42e89-a43a-484a-9552-5942bf237f09.jpg

As GenAI becomes integrated into leadership practices, HR functions will need to reconsider their fundamental approach.\n\nThe early applications of GenAI in HR have primarily focused on efficiency—automating candidate screening, accelerating onboarding processes, and streamlining administrative tasks. While these applications deliver immediate value, they represent only the beginning of what's possible. The futureback view suggests HR will evolve toward effectiveness rather than mere efficiency.\n\nThis evolution mirrors the broader shift described in Table 1, where leaders move from "efficiency and speed" toward "effectiveness and calm." For HR specifically, this means developing frameworks where technology enhances human capabilities rather than simply replacing tasks. For example, rather than using GenAI solely to screen resumes faster, HR leaders might deploy it to identify unexpected talent patterns that challenge conventional hiring assumptions.\n\nThe clarity skill becomes essential as HR leaders articulate what "good work" means in an augmented environment. In a BANI future—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—HR cannot offer certainty about career paths or skill requirements. Instead, they must develop clarity stories that acknowledge uncertainty while providing direction.\n\nWhen considering the dilemma-flipping skill, HR leaders might reframe the tension between automation and human work. Rather than asking "which jobs will be automated?" they might ask "how can we design work systems where humans and technology complement each other's strengths?"\n\nThe concept of bounce ropes, rather than rigid guardrails, applies particularly to HR policies around GenAI use. Flexible frameworks that protect organizational values while allowing for experimentation will prove more effective than rigid rules that quickly become outdated as technology evolves.\n\nAs personal agents evolve into more complex systems, HR will need to reimagine how performance, development, and collaboration function when both humans and agents contribute to outcomes. This represents a significant departure from traditional talent management approaches built for human-only workforces.	2025-04-04 18:34:11.251372+00	1	f	f

As leaders navigate increasingly BANI (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible) environments, HR functions could evolve beyond traditional administrative roles toward what some organizations are beginning to call "talent ecosystem orchestration."\n\nThis evolution might be enabled by the interplay between three of the future leadership skills. Augmented bio-engagement could help HR practitioners view their organizations as living systems rather than mechanical structures. Early signals of this shift appear in companies experimenting with organizational network analysis tools that reveal informal relationship patterns. These tools, enhanced by GenAI capabilities, might help HR leaders identify both resilience and vulnerability within their human systems.\n\nThe commons creating skill might become particularly relevant as workforce boundaries blur. Some organizations are already establishing digital commons where employees, contractors, and digital tools collaborate. These experimental spaces suggest possible futures where HR leaders might need to design new governance approaches for shared resources that include both human and machine contributors.\n\nThe depolarizing skill could prove valuable as tensions emerge between different perspectives on augmentation. Current debates about workplace surveillance and algorithmic management hint at deeper questions that might arise: How might human contribution be valued in augmented teams? What ethical frameworks might guide decisions about technology adoption?\n\nHR leaders might find themselves navigating between competing priorities. On one hand, present-forward thinking emphasizes efficiency gains through automation. On the other, futureback thinking suggests opportunities to amplify distinctly human capabilities—creativity, ethical reasoning, and meaning-making—through thoughtful augmentation.\n\nOne possible future might see HR leaders becoming stewards of human potential in augmented environments, helping organizations balance technological capabilities with human needs. Another scenario might involve HR functions themselves becoming highly augmented, with GenAI tools handling routine decisions while human practitioners focus on complex ethical dilemmas and relationship building.\n\nThe path forward remains uncertain, but signals suggest HR leaders who develop both technological fluency and deep human understanding might be best positioned to navigate these emerging possibilities.	2025-04-04 18:36:30.554935+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c0bd327e-ab91-46d3-808c-aaf66973a229.jpg

By 2030, CIOs who embrace the futureback mindset will design systems that enhance human effectiveness rather than simply pursuing efficiency.\n\nThis evolution requires CIOs to develop what Toyama might recognize as intention, discernment, and self-control in their approach to GenAI. When evaluating new technologies, CIOs must ask: "Does this tool help our leaders develop clarity without promising false certainty?"\n\nIn practice, this means creating flexible environments—bounce ropes rather than guardrails—where teams can experiment with GenAI while maintaining appropriate boundaries. A healthcare CIO might establish protocols allowing clinicians to use GenAI for research synthesis while preserving human judgment for patient care decisions.\n\nAs human/agent swarms emerge, CIOs will establish governance frameworks that acknowledge their distributed nature. Rather than controlling every interaction, effective CIOs will establish principles that guide how these collaborative systems operate. For example, a manufacturing CIO might create guidelines for how production teams interact with agent-assisted design tools while preserving human oversight of safety-critical decisions.\n\nCIOs will also help their C-suite colleagues articulate their own augmentation needs using the "I want help... in order to..." template. A CIO might work with the CFO to define: "I want help analyzing market signals, in order to make more informed investment decisions."\n\nThe most valuable CIOs will model human calming as they navigate technology decisions. By stepping back from the noise of vendor promises and taking time for reflection, they'll help their organizations distinguish between tools that merely automate existing processes and those that genuinely augment leadership capabilities.\n\nThis approach to technology leadership aligns with the shift from present-forward efficiency to futureback effectiveness—a journey where the boundaries between human and machine intelligence become increasingly nuanced, but where human values and judgment remain central.	2025-04-04 18:42:07.589333+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/6dcc47ab-fb50-4f5f-9399-13be53fd023b.jpg

When military leaders make strategic decisions, they weigh consequences that directly impact human lives. As one young soldier at the Army War College discovered, military training often doesn't prepare individuals for the complex human dimensions of their work, such as going door-to-door in Iraq to introduce citizens to democracy while trying to understand their cultural context.\n\nGenerative AI will help leaders explore these dilemmas by mapping relationships between medical technology, ethics, cultural beliefs, and economic factors. However, the final decisions remain human responsibilities that require both reflection and action.\n\nThe Lambeth Conference demonstrated how polarized groups can engage in thoughtful conversation about deeply divisive issues. Similarly, leaders must create spaces where different perspectives on life and death can be examined without rushing to judgment or delaying decisions indefinitely.\n\nBio-engagement offers a framework for approaching these dilemmas. At Polyface Farm, the Salatin family operates with principles of transparency, respect for natural cycles, and recognition of individuality. These same principles could inform how we approach end-of-life care and medical decision-making.\n\nWhen Dr. Dye had his healthy knee cut open without anesthetic, he gained greater understanding of his patients' experiences with knee pain. This direct engagement changed his approach to treatment, often leading him to recommend simple solutions like applying frozen peas rather than rebuilding knees surgically.\n\nLeaders can flip life-and-death dilemmas by asking different questions: What if our healthcare systems prioritized quality of life rather than merely extending it? What if we viewed death not as a problem to solve but as a natural process requiring engagement?\n\nThe space between judging too soon and deciding too late is where leaders must learn to operate. Like General Patton, who saw opportunity where his staff saw only hopeless encirclement, leaders need to develop the capacity to reframe situations and see possibilities where others perceive only limitations.	2025-04-04 19:33:55.950288+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/9c7b7229-c25b-4c3c-96e7-857ab70505a0.jpg

As generative AI systems become more sophisticated, they will increasingly serve as tools for exploring the ethical, legal, and personal dimensions of end-of-life decisions, without providing definitive answers.\n\nThese systems will help leaders map the relationships between competing values: autonomy versus protection, dignity versus sanctity of life, personal choice versus societal norms. However, as with all hallucinations in generative AI, the value lies not in the system providing a "correct" answer, but in its ability to facilitate human meaning-making at the edges of our expertise.\n\nWhen confronting questions about assisted suicide, leaders must acknowledge when they are at the edge of their knowledge. Strong opinions, strongly held will be dangerous. Instead, leaders should use generative AI to explore analogies, models, and unknowns while clearly labeling fabrications as part of an exploratory exercise.\n\nSmart mob swarms will likely form around end-of-life issues, similar to how the Patient-Led Research Collaborative emerged from a Slack group of people with long COVID. These swarms, augmented by generative AI tools, will conduct collaborative research, share information, and potentially advocate for policy changes. Tools like Elicit, which speeds up literature reviews and automates systematic analyses, will empower these groups to challenge traditional medical and legal frameworks.\n\nThe re-enchantment of our world through generative AI may also transform how we approach death. Rather than viewing death through a purely secular, medical lens, these systems might help us explore the mysteries and invisible dimensions of dying. They could facilitate conversations that honor diverse cultural and spiritual perspectives on death, creating spaces where polarized groups can engage in thoughtful conversation about deeply divisive issues.\n\nLeaders must navigate between governments that allow volatile smart mob swarms to create shocks in healthcare systems and those that attempt to control all discourse around assisted suicide.

As societies grapple with questions of bodily autonomy, mental health, and end-of-life decisions, leaders must navigate competing ethical frameworks, religious beliefs, and cultural contexts that shape suicide legislation.\n\nGenerative AI will enable leaders to explore the full complexity of suicide laws by modeling different cultural perspectives and potential outcomes of various policy approaches. For example, a leader's digital twin could interact with digital twins representing diverse stakeholders—medical ethicists, religious leaders, mental health professionals, and advocates for bodily autonomy—to simulate conversations that might otherwise be too polarized for productive engagement.\n\nWhen approaching suicide legislation, leaders will need to resist the American tendency that Henry Kissinger identified—treating complex dilemmas as engineering problems to be solved. Instead, they must recognize that suicide laws exist in the realm of dilemmas rather than problems. The question isn't simply whether to permit or prohibit suicide, but how to create frameworks that respect individual dignity while protecting vulnerable populations.\n\nLeaders can flip this dilemma by asking different questions: What if we focused on creating conditions where fewer people desire to end their lives rather than debating the legality of the act itself? What if suicide prevention and assisted dying legislation were viewed as complementary rather than contradictory approaches?\n\nLike General Patton, who saw opportunity where his staff saw only encirclement, augmented leaders must develop the capacity to see beyond binary positions on suicide legislation. They might stand in different places (viewing the issue from the perspective of a terminally ill patient rather than a legislator), use lenses from other domains (applying hospice care principles to suicide prevention), or foster new knowledge by immersing themselves in the lived experiences of those contemplating end-of-life decisions.\n\nThe space between judging too soon (rushing to legislative solutions) and deciding too late (allowing suffering to continue indefinitely) is where leaders must learn to operate when addressing laws around suicide. This requires both the clarity to see the issue from multiple perspectives and the humility to avoid absolute certainty in an inherently complex moral landscape.	2025-04-04 21:09:33.051355+00	3	f	f

As leaders navigate complex ethical landscapes, they must develop a moral compass that is both grounded in human values and responsive to emerging challenges. The case of Virj Kan and the purple sea urchins illustrates this moral complexity. Her work isn't simply about creating economically viable products from urchin shells; it represents a moral choice to restore balance to an ecosystem disrupted by human impact. The moral dimension of her leadership emerges from bio-empathy—understanding that our actions have consequences throughout interconnected natural systems.\n\nThe Salatin family's approach at Polyface Farm similarly embodies a moral framework that honors the "pigness of the pig" and the integrity of natural systems. Their principles aren't just practical farming techniques but moral commitments to transparency, respect for individual creatures, and alignment with nature's patterns. These principles offer leaders a template for moral decision-making that extends beyond agriculture to any domain where humans interact with natural systems.\n\nAs generative AI becomes more prevalent, leaders will need to distinguish between what can be augmented and what must remain fundamentally human. Morality falls squarely in the latter category. Professor Toyama's insights about technology implementation highlight this distinction. The moral qualities of intention, discernment, and self-control cannot be outsourced to algorithms. When leaders face moral dilemmas, they must retreat to what we call "human calming"—a space of reflection untouched by augmentation.\n\nIn a world of ubiquitous computing, moral leadership will require establishing boundaries around technology use. Leaders must ask: What moral principles should guide our deployment of sensors and information processors throughout society? How do we ensure these technologies enhance rather than diminish human dignity and agency? The answers won't come from the technologies themselves but from leaders who have cultivated the capacity for moral reasoning through human calming.\n\nThe future demands leaders who can flip moral dilemmas by seeing beyond false dichotomies. Rather than choosing between technological progress and natural harmony, leaders must find ways to advance both simultaneously, creating new moral commons that benefit future generations.	2025-04-04 21:14:41.629655+00	4	f	f

As societies grapple with questions of autonomy, dignity, and the right to determine one's end of life, leaders will need augmented approaches to navigate these deeply polarized conversations.\n\nGenerative AI can serve as a dilemma-flipping assistant in these contexts. When confronted with the moral complexities of suicide and assisted dying, AI can help leaders identify the underlying assumptions on both sides of the debate. Rather than framing the issue as "sanctity of life VERSUS autonomy," AI might reframe it as "how can we honor both the sanctity of life AND individual autonomy in end-of-life decisions?"\n\nThis reframing process is particularly valuable when leaders encounter polarized viewpoints on suicide. Some religious and cultural traditions view suicide as morally forbidden, while others increasingly recognize individual choice in ending suffering. Leaders must develop what we might call "active empathy" - going beyond merely understanding opposing viewpoints to genuinely feeling the emotional weight behind different moral positions.\n\nThe collaborative instinct becomes essential here. Rather than rushing to judgment or policy decisions, leaders can use AI to simulate paradoxical extremes - what happens in a society that completely prohibits all forms of assisted dying versus one with no restrictions whatsoever? These simulations can reveal unforeseen consequences and push stakeholders toward more nuanced positions.\n\nDigital twins could play a significant role in these conversations. Imagine a leader's digital twin engaging with the digital twins of various stakeholders - religious leaders, medical ethicists, patient advocates - to explore alternative frameworks for addressing suicide that respect diverse moral traditions while acknowledging changing attitudes.\n\nThe tension between clarity and certainty will be particularly acute in this domain. Leaders must resist the pull toward absolute positions ("suicide is always wrong" or "autonomy always trumps other considerations") while still providing clear moral guidance. This requires the flexibility to adapt approaches as new medical technologies, cultural shifts, and ethical frameworks emerge.\n\nIn this space between judging too soon and deciding too late, augmented leaders will create forums for constructive depolarization - spaces where different moral frameworks can be honored while still moving toward policies that acknowledge the profound complexity of human life and death.	2025-04-04 21:18:45.564674+00	5	f	f

As leaders face complex challenges in healthcare, environmental sustainability, and organizational management, those who develop bio-empathy will have a distinct advantage in navigating uncertainty.\n\nConsider Dr. Scott Dye, an orthopedist who chose to have his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to understand knee pain. This radical form of bio-engagement transformed his approach to medicine. While many of his colleagues viewed knee pain as a mechanical problem requiring mechanical solutions, Dr. Dye developed a biological perspective. His personal experience led him to recommend simpler interventions like applying frozen peas rather than rebuilding knees surgically. This approach recognizes that some challenges are dilemmas to be managed rather than problems to be solved.\n\nThe principles demonstrated at Polyface Farm offer a framework for bio-engaged leadership. The Salatin family operates with transparency, allowing anyone to visit anytime. They focus on grass-based agriculture, moving livestock frequently to new "salad bars" that promote landscape healing. They respect the individuality of plants and animals, honoring the "pigness of the pig." They mimic natural patterns and prioritize soil health through earthworm enhancement. These principles are clear about direction but flexible about execution.\n\nLeaders who develop bio-engagement will increasingly recognize that organizations are ecosystems rather than machines. They will observe nature's patterns and rhythms, reflect on personal experiences in the natural world, and integrate these insights into workplace practices. They will learn from nature's resilience and develop a sense of legacy and long-term responsibility.\n\nIn the future, leaders will need to address environmental challenges with the urgency demonstrated by innovators like Virj Kan. Her company, Primitives Biodesign, creates economically valuable products from purple sea urchins that are decimating kelp forests along the California coast. Rather than staying in the lab, she regularly leads urchin culling dives and engages with local fishermen to develop holistic solutions that support natural ecosystems.\n\nThe most successful leaders will be those who can see the world through nature's lens, understanding its underlying patterns and cycles. They will recognize that humans are part of nature, not separate from it, and will lead accordingly.	2025-04-04 21:21:12.384426+00	6	f	f

As pervasive computing networks spread, leaders will face unprecedented scrutiny, with sensing and monitoring tools becoming ubiquitous. This transparency revolution will transform how moral leadership is practiced and perceived.\n\nThe certification systems pioneered by NGOs like Fair Trade Certified and Marine Stewardship Council represent early examples of this shift. These organizations are creating new moral frameworks that transcend traditional regulatory boundaries. In the future, leaders will navigate complex moral terrain where their actions are constantly measured against evolving standards of ethical conduct.\n\nThe Salatin family's approach at Polyface Farm offers a compelling model for moral leadership grounded in bio-empathy. Their principles—transparency, grass-based agriculture, respect for individuality, mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health—establish clear moral direction while allowing flexible execution. By declaring "anyone is welcome to visit the farm anytime" and maintaining "no trade secrets, no locked doors," they demonstrate that moral leadership begins with radical openness.\n\nLeaders who develop moral bio-empathy will recognize that ethical dilemmas, like work-life balance, are not problems to be solved but ongoing challenges to be managed. Ellen Galinsky's reframing of work-life balance as "navigation" acknowledges this reality. Similarly, moral leadership will require continuous navigation rather than rigid adherence to fixed principles.\n\nThe most effective moral leaders will be those who, like Virj Kan, combine technical expertise with deep engagement in natural systems. Kan's work with purple sea urchins demonstrates that moral leadership requires both laboratory innovation and direct engagement with affected ecosystems and communities. Her regular participation in urchin culling dives and collaboration with local fishermen shows that moral leadership cannot be practiced from a distance.\n\nIn the future, moral leadership will require seeing ethical questions through nature's lens. Leaders will need to understand the underlying patterns and cycles of natural systems to make sound moral judgments. They will recognize that respecting the "pigness of the pig," as the Salatins put it, is not merely an agricultural practice but a foundation for societal health and ethical conduct. The most respected leaders will be those who demonstrate strength with humility, practicing quiet transparency rather than self-promotion.	2025-04-04 21:26:01.986678+00	7	f	f

These wicked problems lack clear definitions, have no stopping rules, and offer no true or false solutions—only better or worse ones. They are symptoms of other problems, unique in context, and attempts to solve them often create new problems.\n\nLeaders navigating wickedness must develop a particular form of augmented futureback curiosity that embraces complexity rather than seeking to simplify it. When faced with wicked problems, the traditional command-and-control leadership model becomes not just ineffective but potentially harmful. Leaders who judge too soon, draw simplistic conclusions, or believe chaos will eventually subside are particularly vulnerable when confronting wickedness.\n\nConsider climate change as a quintessential wicked problem. It is brittle in its tipping points, anxiety-inducing in its implications, nonlinear in its progression, and often incomprehensible in its totality. Leaders addressing climate wickedness must be bendable in their thinking, attentive to diverse stakeholders, and neuro-adaptable in their approaches.\n\nThe maker instinct becomes especially valuable when confronting wickedness. As Mark Frauenfelder noted, makers possess "a secret... they don't have a fear of failure." This fearlessness is essential when tackling wicked problems that have no definitive solutions. Leaders must prototype rapidly, learn from failures, and iterate continuously.\n\nFlexive intent—being clear about direction while remaining flexible about execution—becomes the cornerstone of addressing wickedness. Leaders must acknowledge that wicked problems cannot be "solved" in the traditional sense but must be approached with a mindset of continuous engagement and adaptation.\n\nIn the future, augmented leadership will require the capacity to recognize wickedness and respond appropriately. Rather than promising certainty, effective leaders will cultivate clarity. They will use disciplined foresight to make better decisions today while acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of wicked problems. They will build resilient organizations capable of bending without breaking when confronted with wickedness.\n\nThe most successful leaders will be those who can transform wickedness from a source of paralysis into a catalyst for innovation, using futureback thinking to navigate the tumultuous waters of complex, interconnected challenges.	2025-04-04 21:26:46.297564+00	8	f	f

In a BANI world, leaders must develop a moral compass that is both firmly grounded in human ethics and flexible enough to address novel dilemmas created by technological advancement.\n\nThe principles demonstrated at Polyface Farm offer a framework for moral leadership in an augmented age. The Salatins' commitment to transparency—welcoming anyone to visit their farm anytime—establishes a foundation of ethical accountability. Their respect for the "pigness of the pig" represents a moral recognition of inherent nature and purpose. These principles are not rigid rules but rather guideposts that are clear about direction while remaining flexible about execution.\n\nAs leaders increasingly rely on augmentation, they must first look within themselves for moral grounding. Professor Kentaro Toyama's experience introducing digital technologies in developing countries revealed that successful implementation depends more on human qualities than on the technologies themselves. The intention, discernment, and self-control that Toyama identifies as essential human qualities will become the moral pillars of augmented leadership.\n\nLeaders will need to develop what might be called "moral bio-empathy"—the ability to understand and respect the inherent nature of both living systems and technological tools. Just as Virj Kan's approach to the purple sea urchin crisis demonstrates, effective solutions must holistically include all relevant stakeholders and support natural ecosystems rather than simply extracting value from them.\n\nThe moral challenges of augmented leadership will require leaders to regularly step back from technology and engage in human calming. This practice allows leaders to reconnect with their core values before making decisions about how to employ augmentation. The more augmented humans become, the more important it is for those humans to be grounded in their own ethics.\n\nFuture leaders will need to ask themselves not just "What can this technology do?" but "What should this technology do?" They will need to create moral commons—shared ethical frameworks that guide the development and deployment of augmentation technologies for the benefit of future generations.	2025-04-04 21:28:42.142238+00	9	f	f

Dr. Scott Dye, the orthopedist who had his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to understand pain, represents a different way of thinking about medical problems. While many orthopedists view knee pain as a mechanical problem requiring mechanical solutions like artificial knees, Dr. Dye's bio-engagement led him to see knee pain biologically. His experience taught him that sometimes the simplest solutions—like a bag of frozen peas—can be more effective than surgery.\n\nGenerative AI will enhance this biological perspective in medical practice. Medical practitioners will use AI to model complex biological systems and identify patterns that might be missed by human observation alone. This combination of technology and bio-empathy will create new approaches to treatment that work with natural biological processes rather than attempting to control them.\n\nMedical education will incorporate immersive learning experiences similar to what Dr. Dye undertook, though less physically traumatic. Virtual environments will allow practitioners to develop deeper empathy for patient experiences while AI simulations will help them understand biological systems more thoroughly.\n\nHealthcare organizations will benefit from applying principles similar to the Mariners' "make memories" approach. By focusing on patient experience and using AI to provide personalized care, medical practitioners will create healing environments that respect biological needs and processes.\n\nThe challenge for medical leaders will be maintaining human calming—that tenth leadership skill that doesn't use "augmented" as a modifier. As Kentaro Toyama discovered in his technology work, successful implementation of new technologies depends more on human intention, discernment, and self-control than on the technologies themselves. Medical practitioners will need to evaluate AI recommendations through the lens of bio-empathy, asking whether proposed interventions work with or against natural biological processes.\n\nMedicine will increasingly recognize what Dr. Dye discovered through his painful immersive learning experience: that the human body is not a machine to be fixed but a biological system to be understood and supported.	2025-04-04 21:29:55.672745+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/0d3d41e8-91ec-4766-b4d4-37f6a0c0790f.jpg

Painters who embrace futureback curiosity will gain competitive advantages over those who remain fixed in traditional methods.\n\nThe signals of this shift are already visible. The rise of VR painting applications like Tilt Brush and the integration of AI tools like DALL-E into artistic workflows indicate that painters are beginning to work in immersive environments that allow for rapid iteration. These technologies enable a form of rapid prototyping that wasn't previously possible in traditional painting.\n\nPainters will increasingly adopt the "fail early, fail often, fail cheaply" methodology. Rather than spending months on a single canvas, future painters will create multiple iterations quickly, learning from each failure. This mirrors the computer programming approach where quick, imperfect code reveals problems faster than meticulous planning.\n\nImmersive learning experiences will become essential for artistic development. Just as the industrial cleaning products executives gained insights by actually cleaning motel rooms, painters will immerse themselves in unfamiliar environments to develop authentic understanding. A portrait artist might spend time in refugee camps, or a landscape painter might embed with climate scientists in the field. These experiences will provide the emotional connection and first-person learning that cannot be replicated through secondary research.\n\nTwo distinct pathways are emerging for painting's future:\n\nIn the first scenario, painting becomes increasingly integrated with technology. Painters use AI to generate base compositions, VR to prototype in three dimensions, and augmented reality to place their work in virtual galleries accessible worldwide. The definition of "painting" expands beyond physical media.\n\nIn the alternative pathway, painting becomes deliberately analog in response to digital saturation. Painters create immersive physical experiences using traditional materials but incorporating gaming principles to engage viewers. These painters might create "real-play" installations where visitors physically interact with paintings in ways that develop McGonigal's "superpowers" like urgent optimism and social fabric.\n\nBoth pathways require painters to flip the dilemmas they face, viewing constraints as opportunities rather than limitations—just as General Patton reframed being surrounded as an advantage rather than defeat.	2025-04-05 18:33:18.739908+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4e294759-c578-4a25-8004-4c2908935e8f.jpg

This shift aligns with what we've seen in the ten future leadership skills, particularly in how augmented smart mob swarming will reshape organizational structures.\n\nHR departments are already experimenting with GenAI for resume screening and interview scheduling, but these efficiency-focused applications only scratch the surface. The real opportunity lies in what Drucker distinguished as effectiveness—doing the right things rather than just doing things right. HR leaders who develop their clarity skill will be able to articulate how humans and machines can collaborate in ways that enhance human capabilities rather than simply replace them.\n\nConsider how the commons creating skill might manifest in HR practice. Traditional talent development treats skills as proprietary organizational assets. However, signals of change are emerging in companies like Unilever and Microsoft, which are creating talent commons where skills and capabilities flow more freely between teams, departments, and even external partners. These commons include shared learning platforms and collaborative skill development initiatives that recognize the increasingly fluid nature of work.\n\nThe dilemma-flipping skill will be particularly valuable as HR navigates tensions between automation and augmentation. Rather than seeing this as an either/or choice, skilled HR leaders will reframe the dilemma by asking: "How might we automate routine tasks while simultaneously creating new opportunities for meaningful human work?" This approach acknowledges both the efficiency benefits of automation and the uniquely human capabilities that machines cannot replicate.\n\nAs shape-shifting organizations become more common, HR will need to facilitate smart mob swarms where teams form and dissolve around specific challenges. These swarms will include both human employees and AI agents, requiring HR to develop new approaches to team formation, performance management, and cultural cohesion.\n\nThroughout these changes, the human calming skill will remain essential. As work environments become increasingly augmented, HR leaders who can create psychological safety and help employees navigate constant change will provide a crucial counterbalance to the acceleration of technology. This human-centered approach will distinguish truly effective HR leaders from those who merely implement technological solutions without considering their human impact.	2025-04-05 18:45:39.664033+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/44dcde9b-e2ce-4d8c-9b4e-4a6f481d244e.jpg

Building on the immersive learning examples like Dr. Dye's knee examination and Campbell's war gaming simulations, we can expect new tools that engage multiple senses simultaneously.\n\nThe WorldBoard concept that Jim Spohrer envisioned at Apple is beginning to materialize through augmented reality technologies. These tools allow digital information to overlay physical spaces, creating hybrid environments where leaders can practice complex skills without real-world consequences. A manufacturing executive might walk through a production line seeing both physical machinery and digital information about resource flows, enabling better decision-making about sustainability practices.\n\nGenerative AI tools are beginning to create more sophisticated simulations that respond to user input. This capability connects to Campbell's approach at the Army War College, where he continuously adjusted scenarios to challenge participants appropriately. Future simulations might monitor a leader's engagement level and adapt accordingly, providing just enough challenge without overwhelming them.\n\nThese technologies offer three potential pathways for leadership development:\n\nFirst, they could enable "perspective-taking" experiences where leaders temporarily inhabit different roles within their organization or ecosystem. Unlike Dr. Dye's extreme approach of experiencing knee pain firsthand, these simulations would provide insights without physical discomfort.\n\nSecond, they might create temporal simulations where leaders can explore potential consequences of decisions over different time horizons, addressing the challenge of nonlinear thinking in a BANI world.\n\nThird, they could facilitate collaborative immersion where teams engage in shared experiences, building on the "sense of social fabric" that McGonigal identified as one of gaming's superpowers.\n\nEach pathway presents different challenges. Perspective-taking simulations risk oversimplification of complex experiences. Temporal simulations might create false confidence in predictions. Collaborative immersions could reinforce existing biases if not carefully designed.\n\nThe most effective applications will likely combine elements of all three approaches while maintaining what the book describes as "open-mindedness beyond what many top executives can muster."	2025-04-05 18:56:54.740198+00	1	f	f

The concept of "failing gracefully at the edge of expertise" that we discussed earlier becomes particularly relevant here. Leaders who encounter individuals with schizophrenia are often at the edge of their expertise, and GenAI can help them acknowledge this boundary while still providing meaningful support.\n\nDigital twins, which we described as virtual simulations of a leader's priorities, values, and strategies, could serve as intermediaries. A person experiencing schizophrenia might develop a digital twin that helps translate their perceptions into forms more readily understood by others. This extends the communication benefits of digital twins beyond what we've previously discussed, where "digital twins will interact in increasingly sophisticated ways with other digital twins and GenAI resources."\n\nThe depolarization skills we outlined—active listening, active empathy, open communication, collaborative instinct, and flexibility—become essential when working with diverse cognitive experiences. Rather than viewing unusual perceptions solely as symptoms to be eliminated, leaders can apply these skills to create environments where different cognitive styles contribute meaningfully.\n\nThis approach aligns with our discussion of bounce ropes versus guardrails. As we noted, "for a technology as emergent as GenAI, a bounce rope is a much more appropriate analogy than a guardrail." Similarly, mental health support augmented by GenAI will need the flexibility of bounce ropes rather than rigid guardrails, adapting to individual experiences rather than enforcing standardized approaches.\n\nThe human-agent swarms we described, where "individual agents will be organized into swarms for collective actions," could create supportive networks combining human empathy with AI-powered pattern recognition. This extends our concept of "human–computer partnerships creating new kinds of collaborative intelligence" to building resilient support systems.\n\nThis connects to what we called "re-enchanting our world." As we noted, "most of today's world seems disenchanted and increasingly secular. How might GenAI help to re-enchant our world?" By helping us understand diverse cognitive experiences, GenAI might reveal value in perspectives traditionally marginalized, creating what David Rose might recognize as a form of "enchanted" understanding.	2025-04-05 20:10:54.970796+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c4e412d2-8429-4d78-a4ac-9b86d931d43a.jpg

Dr. Scott Dye, an orthopedist, demonstrated this when he had his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to better understand knee pain. This experience gave him greater bio-empathy for his patients and a deeper appreciation for the human knee's design. Rather than immediately rebuilding knees, Dr. Dye now explores alternatives first, sometimes recommending something as simple as a bag of frozen peas to manage pain.\n\nBy 2034, healthcare will become a major economic driver within the global well-being ecosystem. The combination of biology, life sciences, and digital media will create new approaches to health that extend beyond treating illness to promoting wellness. Healthcare organizations will increasingly view themselves as ecosystems rather than machines, adopting principles similar to those Scott Jenkins implemented at the Seattle Mariners' stadium. Jenkins created feedback systems that showed staff their energy usage and rewarded conservation efforts, treating the ballpark as a living environment rather than a facility to be managed.\n\nGenerative AI will play a role in healthcare's evolution. The algorithms that DeepMind used to develop AlphaFold for protein folding will enable new gene-based treatments. However, this will require substantial computational resources. Just as data centers for AI are expected to reach 35 gigawatts by 2030 in the United States alone, healthcare systems will need to balance technological advancement with environmental impact.\n\nHealthcare facilities may adopt design principles from nature, similar to the Eastgate Centre in Harare, Zimbabwe, which uses termite mound airflow principles for temperature regulation without conventional heating or air-conditioning. These biomimetic approaches will reduce energy consumption while creating healing environments.\n\nHealthcare leaders who develop bio-engagement will observe natural patterns, reflect on experiences in the natural world, and integrate these insights into their practices. They will understand that human health exists within broader natural systems and that respecting these connections leads to better outcomes for patients and the planet alike.	2025-04-05 20:12:49.913575+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4252eb56-a338-4064-b57f-6f11f75872cd.jpg

As leaders navigate trade barriers, they can apply the principles of commons creating to develop shared infrastructures that benefit multiple trading partners.\n\nA potential "tariff commons" could function similarly to the Svalbard International Seed Vault, which preserves agricultural diversity through international cooperation. The seed vault, built into a mountain near the North Pole, stores millions of seed varieties at minus 18 degrees centigrade, with contributions from countries worldwide. This model of trust and shared resources could inspire new approaches to international trade.\n\nGenerative AI tools might help identify patterns in complex tariff structures across jurisdictions. These tools could assist leaders in finding opportunities for reciprocity and simulating various scenarios before implementation.\n\nDiaspora communities, which the book describes as natural commons with strong shared values, could facilitate new tariff arrangements. As noted in the background insights, "Diasporas are commons by definition: they have strong shared values and common points of view on the world." Their cross-border connections might create beneficial scenarios for both their countries of origin and residence.\n\nBrazil's approach to open-source software offers a parallel worth considering. The book explains how Brazil became "a leader in open-source thinking and applying that logic to the creation of innovation spaces that seed science and technology innovation." Nations might develop similar "open-source" approaches to certain trade categories, establishing baseline rules while allowing for competitive differentiation.\n\nLeaders skilled in commons creating need to look beyond zero-sum thinking in tariff negotiations. Instead, they could identify shared assets that simultaneously benefit multiple trading partners, such as standardized customs protocols or collaborative approaches to supply chain management.\n\nThis approach aligns with the book's definition that "commons creating is about growing markets, not just market share," shifting focus from protecting narrow interests to developing markets that benefit stakeholders across borders.	2025-04-05 20:19:09.899963+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c2a9f2d7-20d6-45d6-b7f3-1f3ed74057bf.jpg

As digital economies become more interconnected, tariffs will increasingly serve as negotiating points for access to shared resources.\n\nLeaders who understand commons creating will see how tariff structures can be reimagined. The open-source software movement in Brazil provides an instructive example. The Brazilian government began supporting open-source software development as an alternative to proprietary systems, creating a platform that benefited their entire economy while reducing dependency on foreign technology companies.\n\nGenAI tools will help leaders model complex trade relationships, allowing them to identify potential win-win scenarios where strategic tariff reductions could create larger shared value. For instance, nations might coordinate to reduce tariffs on components for renewable energy infrastructure while maintaining them on competing technologies.\n\nEffective leaders will view tariffs within a reciprocity framework rather than a purely transactional one. The Svalbard International Seed Vault, a storage facility near the North Pole that preserves crop diversity for future generations, demonstrates how nations can contribute to a commons despite other tensions. Similarly, future trade agreements might establish special provisions around critical shared resources like water purification technology or pandemic response capabilities.\n\nDiasporas—communities with strong shared values and common viewpoints—will influence tariff negotiations through their cross-border relationships. Leaders can work with these networks to establish trust and build new commons across traditional trade barriers.\n\nThe challenge will be maintaining clarity without falling into certainty. International tariff systems reflect cultural, economic, and political differences. Leaders who approach negotiations with what anthropologist Edward Hall called "cross-cultural grace"—the ability to understand the "out of awareness" aspects of communication—will be most successful at depolarizing trade conflicts and creating commons that allow competition at higher levels.	2025-04-05 20:25:59.039965+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/60b7ed58-6577-4c6b-b35f-75d480ad7c80.jpg

As leaders seek to build shared assets that benefit multiple players, they will need to navigate the complex landscape of trade barriers that can inhibit collaboration across borders.\n\nA new approach might emerge that we could call "tariff navigation commons." This would function similarly to how the Svalbard International Seed Vault operates as a shared resource. The Seed Vault, built into a mountain near the North Pole, preserves crop diversity by storing millions of seed varieties at minus 18 degrees centigrade, with contributions from countries worldwide. In a parallel fashion, business coalitions could establish shared platforms that pool resources to navigate tariff complexities, sharing regulatory intelligence and compliance strategies.\n\nGenerative AI will likely serve as an infrastructure for these new commons, analyzing international trade agreements and tariff schedules to identify opportunities for mutual benefit. Leaders who use these tools effectively will be able to develop strategies that create value across supply chains.\n\nWe can look to Brazil's experience with open-source software as an instructive example. As described in the background material, Brazil became a leader in open-source thinking when it began phasing out closed-source software like Microsoft in favor of Linux. This government-supported commons approach made technology more accessible and transparent while creating opportunities for Brazilian innovation. Similarly, trade organizations might develop open-source tools that help businesses navigate tariff regimes.\n\nDiaspora communities—groups with strong shared values and common viewpoints who regularly practice sharing within their communities—could play a significant role in tariff navigation. These communities, as described in the background material, can create new commons structures quickly because sharing is already part of their practice.\n\nThe concept of reciprocity, which focuses on exchange and interpersonal terms of engagement with many embedded transactions, could also apply to tariff navigation. Unlike traditional transactions where each player focuses exclusively on getting the greatest value for themselves, reciprocity considers potential value for a wider range of players. Applied to tariffs, this approach would seek structures that ensure fair value exchange across borders while benefiting multiple parties.	2025-04-05 20:30:42.086661+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/1e561686-d10c-475a-acbd-58e4e4fc8db6.jpg

The creation of these commons will follow patterns similar to what we've seen in other sectors, but with unique characteristics suited to the mining context.\n\nBy 2030, rural West African communities will likely develop AI-powered environmental monitoring platforms that create shared information assets. These platforms will function similarly to how the Svalbard International Seed Vault preserves crop diversity, except they will preserve and share environmental data that benefits all stakeholders in the mining ecosystem.\n\nDiaspora networks will play a crucial role in these new mining commons. Just as Dr. Anil Gupta's Honey Bee Network documented traditional knowledge across multiple countries, West African mining communities will connect with their global diaspora to create knowledge-sharing platforms that combine local expertise with technical innovations from abroad.\n\nThe reciprocity model that underlies successful commons will reshape mining relationships. Rather than simple extraction, mining operations will evolve toward exchanges that create value for multiple parties simultaneously. This mirrors how Brazil has developed open-source innovation spaces that seed technology development while benefiting broader communities.\n\nThese mining commons will incorporate bio-engagement principles similar to those practiced at Polyface Farm, where operations are designed to work with natural systems rather than against them. Mining operations will increasingly be evaluated not just on extraction efficiency but on how they contribute to ecosystem health.\n\nThe coordination of these new mining commons will happen through what we might call augmented smart mob swarms—dynamic networks of stakeholders using GenAI tools to coordinate actions across geographic and organizational boundaries. Like the emerging patterns we see in platforms such as Butterflies AI, these networks will blend human and AI interactions to create new forms of coordination that were previously impossible.\n\nLeaders in this space will need the commons-creating skills outlined in our checklist: visionary insight, collaborative spirit, technological savvy, and ethical leadership. The most successful will be those who can see beyond today's competitive landscape to tomorrow's collaborative one.	2025-04-05 20:32:55.350869+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/83a98c5a-e569-4a50-b1c5-492c360a38a9.jpg

The Lambeth Conference of 2008 demonstrated a practical approach to constructive depolarization when facing deep theological divides. During this 19-day summit, rather than forcing positions or votes, the conference employed an African Zulu method called Indaba, which created space for bishops to engage as people rather than as representatives of polarized positions.\n\nLooking ahead, Episcopal congregations might explore multiple pathways for maintaining communion amid disagreement. One possibility is that some parishes could adapt the Book of Provocation approach—the modified Foresight-Insight-Action Cycle created by the Institute for the Future for the Consortium of Endowed Episcopal Parishes. This approach helped stimulate conversations among church members about what they have in common as they think about the future, despite present conflicts.\n\nAs digital technologies become more prevalent, Episcopal communities might face new tensions similar to those experienced during the gay ordination controversy. Some congregations might embrace technology in worship and community-building, while others might resist it as incompatible with tradition. The Anglican three-legged stool of scripture, reason, and tradition could provide a framework for these discussions, though interpretations will likely vary widely.\n\nEpiscopal leaders might benefit from developing skills similar to those demonstrated at the Lambeth Conference, where the emphasis was on personal contact rather than pushing through ideas or positions. As Canon Gregory Cameron noted during that conference, "No organization exists without internal conflict—not even the church. What is important is that organizations achieve enough unity to continue to fulfill their purposes."\n\nThe Episcopal Church's globally networked structure could serve as either a strength or weakness in addressing future challenges. On one hand, its diaspora nature and history of openness might allow for adaptation to changing circumstances. On the other hand, as demonstrated by the gay ordination controversy, this diffuse global network can struggle with questions of authority when fundamental theological issues arise.	2025-04-05 20:35:11.665478+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4437eb79-d2fa-447f-b447-999b9ed7c1b1.jpg

Similar to how the Anglican Communion faced deep divisions over the ordination of gay bishops, this conflict involves stakeholders who hold positions with absolute certainty, making constructive depolarization exceptionally challenging.\n\nFaith-based diplomacy offers a potential approach to this conflict. As described earlier, traditional mediation often considers religion out of bounds, seeking secular resolutions. Faith-based diplomacy, however, brings religious representatives from conflicting sides together to share precepts from each faith that speak to forgiveness and reconciliation. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, this would mean Jewish and Muslim religious leaders finding common theological ground while acknowledging their differences.\n\nThe Indaba method used at the Lambeth Conference provides another model. This African Zulu approach brought together bishops from around the world in small groups to engage in personal contact rather than position-taking. Applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such a process could create spaces where participants get to know each other as people first, not just as representatives of opposing sides.\n\nIn the BANI future, leaders addressing this conflict will need tools for constructive depolarization. Generative AI could function like the CCL card decks mentioned earlier, "putting something in the middle" to mediate conversations. These tools might analyze narratives from both sides, identifying potential bridges while respecting deeply held beliefs.\n\nThe threshold of righteousness—where groups believe they are right and everyone else is wrong—manifests strongly in this conflict. Leaders will need to demonstrate what the book describes as "cross-cultural grace": the ability to listen and learn from people who are very different, offering consideration and respect even in disturbing differences.\n\nVirtual environments, similar to the gaming approaches discussed in earlier chapters, could create safe spaces for Israelis and Palestinians to experience alternative perspectives. Just as virtual environments have been used to treat PTSD in veterans, immersive experiences might build empathy between conflicting parties.\n\nAs digital tools become more accessible, even to poor communities, organizing across borders will increase. The future of this conflict will likely involve multiple stakeholders connected through digital networks, making the leader's role in constructive depolarization even more critical in preventing further entrenchment of absolutist positions.	2025-04-05 20:53:14.954403+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f4705cd4-1a3b-4106-b66f-9a81eacd12f5.jpg

Chuck Palus and Wilfred Drath at the Center for Creative Leadership discovered that "putting something in the middle" helps calm tense situations and establishes constructive dialogue. In their work, they created card decks and visual libraries that mediate conversations between people stuck in conflict. GenAI will function similarly in therapeutic settings, providing that "something in the middle" that allows leaders to examine their challenges from new perspectives.\n\nLeaders facing the brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (BANI) future will use GenAI-supported therapy to develop their clarity story while managing uncertainty. Just as Dr. Scott Dye gained deeper understanding of knee pain by having his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic, leaders will need to develop empathy through direct engagement with difficult experiences, supported by AI tools that help process and integrate these learnings.\n\nGenAI will enhance therapeutic practices by offering personalized approaches based on leadership styles and specific challenges. Similar to how the Sisu.is app translates communication across different personality types, therapeutic AI will help leaders communicate effectively across diverse teams. This capability connects to constructive depolarization, where leaders must understand multiple perspectives before attempting resolution.\n\nThe therapeutic applications of digital twins will allow leaders to practice difficult conversations in simulated environments. These simulations will function like the immersive learning described earlier, providing safe spaces to fail and learn without real-world consequences.\n\nLeaders must balance AI-mediated therapy with human connection. The concept of bounce ropes rather than guardrails applies here—flexible boundaries that allow for adaptation while maintaining ethical standards. Leaders who over-rely on AI for emotional processing risk diminishing their bio-engagement skills, which require direct observation and reflection on natural patterns.\n\nThe most effective approach will be augmentation rather than automation of therapy. Leaders will use GenAI to enhance their capacity for healing conversations while maintaining their human empathy and connection. This balance reflects the broader leadership challenge of finding clarity without false certainty in an increasingly uncertain world.	2025-04-05 20:55:37.297708+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e920b369-ce20-43c0-b33a-349c30d0ae49.jpg

As Chuck Palus and Wilfred Drath demonstrated with their card decks and visual libraries that serve as mediating objects for constructive dialogue, DBT will provide leaders with structured frameworks for holding opposing viewpoints simultaneously.\n\nGenerative AI will enhance these DBT approaches by creating personalized dialectical exercises. For example, when a leader faces the persistent dilemma of maintaining strong leadership while fostering employee involvement, AI-augmented DBT tools will help them practice the mental flexibility required to see both sides of this challenge—much like flipping between seeing the duck and the rabbit in the optical illusion described earlier.\n\nFuture leaders will employ AI-enhanced DBT in specific ways:\n\nFirst, AI will monitor communication patterns during tense negotiations, providing real-time guidance on balancing validation with change strategies. This represents an evolution of "putting something in the middle"—instead of physical cards, the mediating object becomes an AI-enhanced dialectical framework that helps leaders calm tense situations where differences dominate.\n\nSecond, when facing unsolvable, recurrent challenges with interconnected elements—the characteristics of dilemmas identified in the book—leaders will use DBT-enhanced AI to practice radical acceptance while maintaining decisive action. This approach aligns with Roger Martin's concept of the "opposable mind" that engages constructively with tension between opposing ideas.\n\nThird, AI-DBT tools will help leaders develop what might be called "dialectical intelligence"—the ability to hold multiple truths simultaneously without premature resolution. This skill will be essential as leaders face increasingly brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible situations.\n\nBy 2030, leadership development programs will routinely incorporate AI-enhanced DBT modules that simulate polarized conflicts and guide leaders through dialectical responses. These tools will help leaders distinguish between problems (that can be solved) and dilemmas (that must be flipped), providing another pathway for constructive depolarization in an increasingly divided world.	2025-04-06 00:01:16.513196+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f45fb22a-03e3-4f27-a747-321f596b8e4d.jpg

While pervasive computing and open-source thinking create unprecedented scrutiny of leadership actions, they also enable new approaches to recognizing excellence without self-promotion.\n\nEllen Galinsky's approach to work-life navigation offers a practical model. Rather than positioning herself as the definitive expert, she conducts research, shares methodologies, and creates frameworks that enable others to develop their own approaches. When interviewed on programs like the Today show, she speaks to the issues rather than promoting herself. Her influence grows precisely because she focuses on elevating the field rather than her personal brand.\n\nAugmented leaders will use AI tools to extend this approach across their organizations. These tools will help identify patterns of excellence that might otherwise go unnoticed, particularly from unexpected sources or those without established platforms. Unlike current performance management systems, these tools will be designed to counteract the human tendency to recognize only the most visible contributions.\n\nThe BP example demonstrates the dangers of the alternative approach. By rebranding as "Beyond Petroleum" and promoting their environmental initiatives, they created expectations they couldn't meet and became targets when failures occurred. Their self-promotion ultimately undermined their credibility and amplified criticism when problems emerged.\n\nLeaders practicing elevation of greatness will instead create systems where recognition flows naturally to those making meaningful contributions. They will use their augmented capabilities not to amplify their own voices but to ensure that important work throughout their organizations receives appropriate attention. This approach aligns with the strength-with-humility skill, where influence comes not from self-advertisement but from creating contexts where others can excel.\n\nIn practice, this means designing recognition systems that identify excellence based on impact rather than visibility, and communication channels that elevate ideas regardless of their source. The most effective leaders will be those who become known for their ability to recognize and amplify greatness in others.	2025-04-06 00:03:11.598532+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f652c139-492c-400f-a121-31a0d0e3e644.jpg

The concept extends beyond traditional notions of charisma or commanding presence, particularly as leaders navigate work environments characterized by brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility.\n\nLeaders who demonstrate augmented strength with humility, like Ellen Galinsky in her work on work-life navigation, show how effectiveness doesn't require self-promotion. Galinsky has built significant influence through her research at the Families and Work Institute, appearing on programs like the Today show when work-from-home policies are discussed, yet maintains an understated approach. Her career demonstrates how substantive expertise can generate attraction without developing what the book describes as "an inflated ego."\n\nThe experience of British Petroleum (BP) offers a cautionary example about attractiveness through self-promotion. When BP rebranded as "Beyond Petroleum" and promoted its environmental initiatives, this self-promotion made the company a target rather than building genuine credibility. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion, the company faced intensified criticism partly because its environmental claims had created expectations it couldn't meet. This suggests future leaders may find greater success by doing meaningful work transparently while avoiding excessive self-promotion.\n\nThe Seattle Mariners baseball organization demonstrates another approach to attractiveness through what the book calls "bio-empathy." The Mariners use secret shoppers to evaluate staff on their ability to create memorable experiences for fans, providing immediate feedback on positive behaviors. This system rewards employees for genuine connection rather than performance metrics alone, creating motivation through the fulfillment of creating positive experiences for others.\n\nAs generative AI becomes more integrated into leadership practices, attractiveness may increasingly come from how well leaders balance technological capabilities with human connection. The book suggests that leaders will need to make choices between efficiency and effectiveness, between using technology for simple answer-finding and using it for mind-stretching interactions. Leaders who can use augmented capabilities to enhance rather than replace human connection may find themselves naturally drawing others toward their vision.\n\nThe balance between augmentation and humanity presents a dilemma rather than a problem to be solved. Leaders who acknowledge this complexity while remaining authentically human may create environments where others feel valued, using technology as a tool for connection rather than distance.	2025-04-06 06:10:25.295829+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/5a5f0325-9d0f-4af0-bdaa-1b1672961005.jpg

When organizations contribute to a commons intelligently, they establish ongoing value streams that continue to deliver returns long after the initial contribution. This extends beyond traditional transaction models where value exchange has a clear endpoint.\n\nHugging Face demonstrates this principle in practice. By hosting open-source AI models and providing free coding libraries, they created a system that generated substantial company value while simultaneously benefiting the broader AI ecosystem. Their approach shows how giving away valuable assets with strategic intent can yield returns that accumulate over time.\n\nAs commons creating becomes more prevalent over the next decade, leaders will need to develop new metrics for evaluating long-term reciprocity. Traditional ROI calculations often fail to capture the extended benefits of commons participation that unfold over years. Leaders must articulate these extended value propositions to stakeholders who may be accustomed to more immediate returns.\n\nConsider how manufacturing organizations might contribute production techniques to a shared knowledge base. Each participant receives continuous access to innovations developed by others, technical support from the community, and improved relationships with suppliers who value the collective. The initial contribution creates an ongoing stream of operational advantages.\n\nThis pattern differs from profit-sharing programs. Rather than redistributing existing value, it creates new value through collaboration that would not exist otherwise. The "lifetime supply" emerges from the commons itself and grows as more participants contribute.\n\nAs we face challenges like climate disruption and pandemics, these reciprocity-based systems will help address complex problems that exceed the capacity of individual organizations. The commons-creating leaders who design systems delivering ongoing returns—not just for themselves but for all contributors—will be positioned to navigate the BANI world most effectively.	2025-04-06 15:16:01.47374+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a56d9106-88cb-4914-9b13-399f8fef191f.jpg

While generative AI excels at pattern recognition across vast datasets, human leaders bring an intuitive understanding of recurring narrative structures that have shaped human experience across cultures and throughout history.\n\nDrawing from Engelbart's vision of augmenting human intellect, we can see how archetypal frameworks provide a conceptual scaffold that AI can enhance but not replace. Engelbart's work at Stanford Research Institute in 1962 focused on using technology to expand our conceptual frameworks—not just process information faster. Archetypal patterns represent some of humanity's oldest conceptual frameworks for navigating complexity.\n\nWhen applied to the dilemma flipping skill discussed earlier, archetypal awareness creates new possibilities. Consider how the commons creating challenge identified by Garrett Hardin in his "Tragedy of the Commons" represents a recurring archetypal situation. GenAI tools could analyze communication patterns within stakeholder groups to identify when participants are operating from positions that either support or undermine commons thinking.\n\nThis connects directly to Toyama's three pillars of wisdom—intention, discernment, and self-control—that we must bring to any technological augmentation. The archetypal lens provides a framework for discernment that AI can enhance but not substitute.\n\nSignals of this emerging approach are already visible in organizational development practices that combine data analytics with narrative-based interventions. For example, the Butterflies app mentioned earlier could be extended to identify archetypal patterns in team dynamics, providing leaders with deeper insights into how their groups navigate change.\n\nLooking forward, we might envision multiple pathways for archetypal augmentation:\n\nIn one scenario, leaders use GenAI to identify when their organizations are unconsciously enacting limiting archetypal patterns, allowing for conscious intervention.\n\nIn another, archetypal frameworks become embedded in smart mob organizing tools, helping diverse groups quickly establish shared mental models for collective action.\n\nThe most surprising development may be how archetypal awareness enhances human calming—the final leadership skill in our framework. By recognizing when we're caught in ancient narrative patterns, we gain perspective on our reactions to BANI conditions, creating space for more intentional response.	2025-04-06 15:17:47.952076+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ba0ad3dd-9ac1-4c79-b6cc-e39b34d04227.jpg

While many organizations initially approach commons creation with speed and efficiency in mind, the true value emerges when leaders embrace the futureback view of effectiveness and calm. The commons becomes not just a repository of shared resources but a space for mind-stretching interactions that transcend simple transactional exchanges.\n\nAs GenAI systems mature, they will participate in these commons in ways that go beyond hallucinations toward meaningful co-creation. What we currently label as "hallucinations" in GenAI systems may evolve into valuable contributions to human creativity—becoming features rather than bugs in our collaborative meaning-making processes. Just as Institute for the Future hires people who "fail gracefully at the edge of their expertise," future commons will value GenAI systems that can acknowledge the boundaries of their knowledge while still offering creative possibilities.\n\nThe lifetime supply of winnings from commons participation also connects to the re-enchantment of our world. David Rose's concept of "enchanted objects" points to how AI-enabled systems can make ordinary objects do extraordinary things. Similarly, commons-creating leaders will discover how contributing to shared resources can yield almost magical returns that continue indefinitely. This re-enchantment stands in contrast to the secular control mindset that dominates many current approaches to technology.\n\nAs AI agents become more sophisticated over the next decade, they will dramatically expand the potential of commons creation. These agents—systems that take actions in the digital world to accomplish objectives without predefined steps—will automate the maintenance and expansion of commons resources. Leaders might direct an agent to "analyze all contributions to our commons over the past five years and identify which created the most value for participants," generating insights that further enhance the lifetime supply of winnings.\n\nThe most effective commons-creating leaders will balance present-forward efficiency with futureback effectiveness, using GenAI not merely to automate contributions but to augment their ability to create meaningful, long-lasting value streams that benefit all participants.	2025-04-06 15:19:40.901347+00	2	f	f

Over the next decade, leaders who incorporate forest-thinking into their decision-making will develop more resilient organizations. \n\nScientists have discovered that trees in forests share resources through underground fungal networks. This natural system demonstrates how interconnected parts can support each other while still competing for resources like sunlight. Similarly, organizations that recognize their interdependence with surrounding systems will thrive in unpredictable environments.\n\nThis approach connects directly to the bio-engagement principles practiced at Polyface Farm, where the Salatin family works with natural cycles rather than against them. By 2030, leaders who apply these principles will view their organizations not as machines to be optimized but as living systems to be nurtured.\n\nGenerative AI will accelerate this shift by helping leaders visualize complex organizational ecosystems. Rather than simply analyzing data in isolation, AI tools will map relationships between seemingly unrelated variables, similar to how Dr. Scott Dye approached knee pain as a biological system rather than a mechanical problem.\n\nForest-thinking also introduces longer time horizons into leadership decisions. While quarterly results remain important, leaders will increasingly consider impacts across years and decades. This extended perspective aligns with the bio-engagement checklist's emphasis on "legacy and long-term responsibility for future generations."\n\nAs leaders develop commons creating skills, forest principles will inform how they build shared assets. Just as a healthy forest floor supports diverse species, future leaders will create platforms that benefit multiple stakeholders. These commons will function like the Svalbard International Seed Vault, preserving value while allowing individual entities to thrive.\n\nBy 2035, the most successful organizations will have fully integrated these biological perspectives into their leadership approaches, moving beyond the mechanical thinking that dominated previous eras of management.	2025-04-06 15:20:31.457983+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/f2d5751b-5f49-41d3-a54c-122a0b5ba53e.jpg

When Virj Kan of Primitives Biodesign works with purple sea urchins along the California coast, she's addressing an ecological imbalance by finding economic value in these creatures that have decimated kelp forests. Similarly, our relationships with dogs and cats can serve as entry points to deeper ecological understanding.\n\nThe Salatin family at Polyface Farm demonstrates bio-engagement through their principle of honoring the "pigness of the pig" - allowing animals to express their natural behaviors within farming systems. This approach contrasts with how many people interact with pets, often expecting them to conform to human lifestyles rather than accommodating their biological needs.\n\nIn the coming decade, GenAI tools will likely help bridge this gap. Current developments in animal behavior monitoring technology suggest future systems could help humans better understand pet communication and needs. Just as Scott Jenkins implemented feedback systems at T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field) to help staff track energy usage, similar systems could help pet owners recognize patterns in animal behavior that indicate stress, contentment, or biological needs.\n\nUrban pet ownership presents what the book describes as a dilemma - a situation with no perfect solution. Many city dwellers want animal companionship but lack adequate space or time. Rather than viewing this as an unsolvable problem, leaders might flip this dilemma by developing community-based approaches to pet care. Current signals of this shift include the emergence of pet-sharing apps and cooperative care arrangements.\n\nThe concept of "enchanted objects" that David Rose describes - ordinary items that do extraordinary things through AI - could extend to pet care. Emerging technologies that monitor pet health could evolve into systems that facilitate deeper understanding between species, similar to how Jenkins uses technology to make stadium operations more environmentally responsive.\n\nBy applying bio-engagement principles to our relationships with companion animals, leaders can practice the skill of seeing from nature's perspective in an accessible, daily context - a stepping stone toward addressing larger ecological challenges.	2025-04-06 15:28:09.937705+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4ed8f94a-309d-4a8a-b54a-5a3b49fd320e.jpg

While Virj Kan's work with sea urchins along the California coast demonstrates how economic incentives can help restore natural balance, and Scott Jenkins shows how feedback systems in sports stadiums can promote environmental consciousness, other biological systems offer equally valuable insights.\n\nConsider how certain reptiles demonstrate remarkable adaptability through their specialized biological functions. Nature has evolved countless strategies for resilience that future leaders can study and apply to organizational challenges. Just as Polyface Farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley follows principles of transparency, grass-based agriculture, individuality, mimicking natural patterns, and soil health, organizations might adopt similar biologically-inspired approaches to leadership.\n\nBy 2030, we may see more organizations structuring themselves according to natural systems, with clear pathways for adaptation built into their design. This approach would extend beyond the current practices of bio-engagement that focus primarily on reducing environmental impact. Instead, it would incorporate nature's wisdom about cycles of growth, maintenance, and renewal.\n\nThis connects directly to the dilemma-flipping skill discussed earlier. Natural systems don't solve problems in isolation; they balance competing needs within complex ecosystems. Similarly, leaders must navigate the space between judging too soon and deciding too late, recognizing when an apparent contradiction might actually represent an opportunity.\n\nGenerative AI could assist in modeling these natural processes, helping leaders identify patterns in nature that might inform organizational design. However, as with all augmented leadership skills, the fundamental bio-engagement capability remains deeply human: the ability to observe, understand, and learn from natural systems.\n\nAs we face increasingly complex challenges, leaders who can draw inspiration from nature's four billion years of evolutionary problem-solving will have access to a vast repository of tested solutions. The future of bio-engagement will likely involve not just empathy with nature, but active learning from its intricate systems of adaptation and resilience.	2025-04-06 15:29:00.530137+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c3b82436-67d4-4efa-bf80-357319ab05e4.jpg

Like the Svalbard International Seed Vault, which continues to receive new deposits years after its founding, the most durable commons have built-in mechanisms for renewal and adaptation.\n\nGenAI will enable leaders to design commons with this eternal flame quality by helping them identify what Scott Jenkins might call "the future that's already here." When Jenkins transformed stadium operations for the Seattle Mariners, he didn't just implement green practices - he created feedback systems that made sustainability self-perpetuating. The secret shoppers who attend every game, the real-time energy usage displays, and the culture of shared responsibility for cleanliness all create continuous improvement without constant intervention.\n\nFuture commons creators will use GenAI to design similar self-sustaining feedback loops. For example, a community solar project might use AI to continuously optimize energy distribution while simultaneously generating personalized reports that strengthen participants' commitment to the commons. The technology becomes not just a tool but a guardian of the eternal flame.\n\nThis approach requires leaders to think beyond their own tenure. The Svalbard Vault wasn't designed for immediate benefit but for generations yet unborn. Similarly, Jenkins' work on stadium sustainability extends far beyond quarterly results. The eternal flame of a commons burns longest when leaders design for continuity rather than control.\n\nBio-engagement principles further strengthen this approach. Just as natural systems have built-in regenerative capabilities, well-designed commons include mechanisms for self-renewal. The most durable commons aren't dependent on charismatic leadership but on systems that allow for distributed stewardship.\n\nThe challenge for augmented leaders will be balancing the clarity of purpose that ignites the eternal flame with the flexibility of execution that keeps it burning. GenAI can help by monitoring the health of the commons and suggesting adjustments when necessary, but human judgment remains essential for maintaining the ethical foundations that give the commons its meaning and purpose.	2025-04-06 15:48:37.862784+00	2	f	f

Ellen Galinsky, president and cocreator of the Families and Work Institute (FWI), a nonprofit in New York City, offers a useful model through her work on work-life navigation. Galinsky has explored the interactions between work and private life extensively, reframing "work-life balance" as "navigation," recognizing that balance is impossible to achieve. The interactions between work and private life are not problems to be solved but ongoing, ever-changing dilemmas that must be managed.\n\nThis navigation concept applies equally well to how leaders might view achievement across their careers. In her own quiet way, Galinsky has seeded and cultivated an entire field of study around work-life navigation. Though energetic and outgoing, she is not self-promoting. She writes, speaks, and organizes to spread her message rather than to promote herself. Her strong yet humble style—engaged and open without overselling—exemplifies how lifetime achievement can manifest without constant self-advertisement.\n\nWhen augmented by GenAI, this approach to lifetime achievement can be enhanced through:\n\nImproved Perspective Taking: GenAI can help leaders understand how their contributions fit into larger systems and contexts, similar to how the Center for Creative Leadership notes that vulnerability and authenticity often lead to greater leadership impact than self-promotion.\n\nAdvanced Decision Support: As leaders navigate their career paths, GenAI can help them identify which achievements truly align with their values and which might be pursued merely for recognition.\n\nCultural Competence Enhancement: GenAI can assist leaders in understanding how their achievements are perceived across different cultures and contexts, helping them navigate the dilemma of impact versus recognition.\n\nThe core dilemma remains: How do you reach your full leadership potential and create lasting achievement without constant self-advertisement? As the tools of transparency become ubiquitous, as described in Michael Conroy's work on certification systems and NGO monitoring, leaders will find their achievements documented whether they promote them or not. The quiet leader, content to lead while others get attention, may ultimately create the most sustainable legacy in a world where strength with humility becomes increasingly valuable.	2025-04-06 15:49:31.991176+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/0300dec5-9a24-4700-a94f-716e3a0bf0e2.jpg

Scott Jenkins exemplifies this approach through his work greening sports stadiums. As "Mr. Green Stadium," Jenkins has transformed venues for the Seattle Mariners, Milwaukee Brewers, Philadelphia Eagles, and most recently, the Kansas City Current—the first stadium built specifically for a women's professional sports team.\n\nJenkins' leadership demonstrates that the best augmented leaders combine bio-engagement with human-centered values. At Seattle's T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), he created an environment that is simultaneously family-friendly and environmentally responsible. When he arrived, Jenkins asked a simple but profound question: how much energy does it take to run the entire stadium for one day? When no one knew the answer, he implemented feedback systems that not only measured energy usage but rewarded conservation efforts.\n\nThis approach mirrors what Roy Amara, former president of the Institute for the Future, modeled: an orderly thinker focused on disorderly futures. Like Amara, Jenkins encourages "high conflict about ideas and high respect for people." He maintains this balance while implementing practical solutions—biking to work, driving hybrid vehicles using hyper-mileage principles, and personally picking up litter at the stadium.\n\nThe best augmented leaders will similarly combine principled vision with practical action. They'll recognize, as David Korten notes, that "if this is a competition between humans and nature, nature will win in the long run. But...nobody will really win if the planet dies." They'll see ecological parameters not as limitations but as opportunities, similar to how the Eastgate Centre in Harare uses termite mound principles for natural temperature regulation.\n\nWhen enhanced by GenAI, these leaders will gain unprecedented ability to model complex systems and predict cascading effects of their decisions. They'll use these tools not to control but to collaborate—with their teams, with society, and with natural systems. The best leaders will embody Jenkins' philosophy: "The future is already here—folks just haven't figured it out yet." Their excellence will be measured not by personal achievement alone, but by how effectively they help others navigate toward a sustainable future.	2025-04-06 18:04:07.938508+00	2	f	f

This integration is already emerging in practical applications across various domains.\n\nWhen Scott Jenkins transformed stadium operations for the Seattle Mariners, he implemented feedback systems that made energy usage visible to staff members. These systems didn't replace human decision-making; they enhanced it by providing real-time information that staff could act upon. Jenkins created rewards for energy conservation and used secret shoppers to gather specific feedback about customer experiences. This approach demonstrates how technology can extend human awareness while maintaining human agency in decision-making.\n\nThe distinction between human and machine capabilities follows what researchers have identified as Moravec's Paradox—tasks that humans find easy (like recognizing faces or navigating social situations) often prove difficult for machines, while tasks humans find challenging (like complex calculations) can be simple for computers. Leaders who understand this complementarity can design systems where humans and machines each contribute their strengths.\n\nImmersive learning environments offer promising training grounds for developing this understanding. Just as video game players develop mathematical models and scientific thinking skills through gameplay (as Steinkuehler and Duncan discovered in their study of World of Warcraft players), leaders can use simulations to practice human-machine collaboration. The industrial cleaning company that immersed its executives in the actual work of cleaning motel rooms demonstrates how even simple immersive experiences can transform understanding and lead to better decisions.\n\nLeaders must also consider the ecological consequences of technological systems, applying the principles of bio-engagement that Jenkins modeled in his stadium work. This means examining not just environmental impacts but also effects on organizational culture and human relationships.\n\nComputer scientist Jaron Lanier, who has written extensively about technology's impact on society, reminds us to maintain a grounded view of technology's capabilities. Rather than viewing technologies as magical solutions, effective leaders recognize them as tools with specific strengths and limitations that can be directed toward improving human work when properly understood and thoughtfully implemented.	2025-04-06 18:04:29.0451+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ef59fbb0-831b-4412-b145-d823c2baa48c.jpg

The Foresight-Insight-Action Cycle offers a framework to approach this challenge differently. Rather than viewing time and money as opposing forces where one must be sacrificed for the other, leaders can apply full-spectrum thinking to discover new possibilities between these resources.\n\nThe cycle begins with Prepare, where leaders must resist categorizing time and money as inherently opposed. This means questioning assumptions about their relationship. For example, does investing more time always save money? Does spending more money always save time?\n\nIn the Foresight phase, we can observe signals that point to evolving relationships between time and money. Companies experimenting with four-day workweeks have discovered that reducing work hours (which might seem like sacrificing productivity) actually improves efficiency, reduces turnover costs, and increases employee engagement—creating both time savings and economic benefits.\n\nThe Insight phase reveals that the relationship between time and money isn't fixed but can be reimagined. Consider how Patton approached a battlefield situation where his troops were surrounded by German forces. Where his staff saw a hopeless situation, Patton saw opportunity, noting that the Germans had thinned their resources by surrounding the Allied forces. Similarly, leaders can flip the time-money dilemma by seeing the same situation from a different perspective.\n\nIn the Action phase, leaders can experiment with rapid prototyping approaches to test new time-money relationships. These small experiments, unlike full product launches, don't require massive investment but provide valuable learning about future possibilities.\n\nThe template introduced in the book—"I want help _________, in order to _________"—can guide leaders in specifying how they want to approach the time-money relationship. A leader might say: "I want help identifying where time investments create disproportionate financial returns, in order to allocate resources more effectively."\n\nBy applying curiosity-driven leadership to the time-money relationship, leaders can move beyond seeing these resources as fixed quantities to be traded and instead discover how they can be reconfigured to create new value. This approach transforms what appears to be a zero-sum game into an opportunity for innovation.	2025-04-06 18:13:06.452399+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a3399ffd-25e7-40fb-99f8-8f31d277f1a8.jpg

As digital connectivity expands, the relationship between individual freedoms and shared resources will evolve in practical ways.\n\nLeaders will increasingly use GenAI to identify and develop digital commons that support both personal liberty and collective well-being. Similar to how the Svalbard International Seed Vault stores millions of seed varieties at minus 18 degrees centigrade to preserve crop diversity, organizations will build digital repositories of knowledge and cultural assets that serve as platforms for future innovation.\n\nThe definition of government as "what we choose to do together" takes on new meaning when GenAI enables more voices to participate in decision-making. This technology will help leaders include diverse perspectives when searching for common ground, making governance more responsive to complex needs.\n\nWe can see early examples of this approach in environmental leadership. Consider how some coastal California communities are addressing the collapse of kelp forests. When purple urchins' natural predators died from disease around 2015, the urchin population exploded and devoured coastal kelp, threatening marine ecosystems and local fishing economies. Leaders like those at Primitives Biodesign are creating economic incentives to remove urchins by developing valuable products from their shells, aligning economic activity with ecological restoration.\n\nThis approach demonstrates how leaders can create commons that allow both individual enterprise and collective benefit to coexist. Rather than seeing liberty and collective good as opposing forces, effective leaders will design systems where personal freedom contributes to shared assets.\n\nThe principles practiced at Polyface Farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley offer another model. Their approach to agriculture emphasizes transparency, grass-based livestock management, respect for animal nature, and soil health. These clear principles about direction with flexibility in execution allow for individual innovation within a framework that benefits the larger ecosystem.\n\nAs the world becomes more brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible, leaders who can create commons that support both life and liberty will be increasingly valuable. They will help people navigate uncertainty while preserving the shared resources on which all depend.	2025-04-06 18:18:24.612439+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c208449d-e04e-47df-88ea-c7d658d16581.jpg

Just as Virj Kan works with sea urchins to create economically valuable products while restoring kelp forests, future pet care systems will align economic incentives with animal wellbeing.\n\nGenAI tools will help interpret animal behavior patterns, not by anthropomorphizing pets but by recognizing what the Salatin family of Polyface Farm might call the "dogness of dogs" or "catness of cats." The Salatins operate their farm by respecting the natural behaviors of animals and creating systems that allow them to express their physiological distinctiveness. Similarly, AI systems might analyze a dog's movement patterns to suggest environmental modifications that better suit their natural behaviors.\n\nThis approach will face practical challenges. Pet product companies may continue marketing items that appeal to human aesthetics rather than animal needs. Veterinary care might rely too heavily on technological monitoring at the expense of hands-on observation. These are not problems to solve but dilemmas to flip.\n\nLeaders in pet care industries will need to immerse themselves in these dilemmas before acting. They might ask: How can we use technology to enhance rather than replace direct engagement with animals? What can we learn from successful bio-engagement models like Polyface Farm, where transparency and mimicking natural patterns are foundational principles?\n\nThe economic opportunities will emerge from this immersion. Companies that develop products based on actual animal behavior data rather than human projections will likely find new market niches. Urban planners might incorporate pet-friendly designs that work with natural behaviors rather than restricting them.\n\nFor leaders developing these systems, the skill of dilemma flipping will be essential. They must avoid judging too soon (assuming technology alone can interpret animal needs) or deciding too late (waiting for perfect solutions while animal welfare issues persist). Instead, they'll need to explore the space between, using GenAI to enhance rather than replace their understanding of the animals that share our homes.	2025-04-06 18:26:43.036518+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/d011082c-6ebb-4acf-a823-b53a476e2947.jpg

As systems become more brittle and changes more nonlinear, leaders must develop specific skills to bridge divides between different groups.\n\nThe Episcopal Church case study illustrates this challenge. When faced with polarization over the ordination of gay bishops, the Anglican Communion employed specific techniques to maintain unity despite profound disagreements. Their "Book of Provocation" approach used forecasting to stimulate conversations about shared futures rather than present conflicts. This technique didn't predict outcomes but created space for dialogue across deep divides.\n\nAt the 2008 Lambeth Conference, leaders employed the Zulu Indaba method to address polarization. This approach organized bishops into small groups of eight for Bible study, which then combined into larger groups of forty. Each group had specific roles: an animateur to facilitate, a rapporteur to document, and a listener to summarize. This structure emphasized personal connection over position-taking. As Canon Gregory Cameron noted during the conference, "No organization exists without internal conflict... What is important is that organizations achieve enough unity to continue to fulfill their purposes."\n\nLeaders in the next decade will need similar methodologies for constructive depolarization. When people exceed their capacity for disruption, they often seek simplified certainty—a psychological reaction to overwhelming uncertainty. Effective leaders will recognize this pattern and create structured environments where people can engage across differences while maintaining clarity about shared purposes.\n\nCross-cultural grace will be essential in this work. As anthropologist Edward T. Hall observed, "We must learn to understand the 'out of awareness' aspects of communication. We must never assume that we are fully aware of what we communicate to someone else." This insight becomes more relevant as leaders engage with increasingly diverse stakeholders across multiple dimensions of difference.\n\nThe threshold between clarity and certainty will be a critical boundary for leaders to navigate. Clarity includes knowing what you don't know; certainty does not. By creating structured spaces for engagement across differences, leaders can help organizations maintain unity of purpose while honoring diversity of perspective.	2025-04-06 19:30:29.156424+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/1a180fc2-ae47-419d-8b55-1ae7171d9e92.jpg

As pervasive computing networks expand, leaders face a new reality where their histories—both professional and personal—exist in an ever-expanding digital archive. This creates a fundamental dilemma for augmented leadership.\n\nThe tension between transparency and privacy manifests in how leaders integrate their past experiences into their current leadership approach. Ellen Galinsky's work at the Families and Work Institute demonstrates this balance. Rather than promoting herself, Galinsky has built authority through consistent contribution to work-life navigation research. Her approach shows how leaders can develop influence without self-promotion—a signal of how effective leadership might evolve in a world of increased scrutiny.\n\nThis connects directly to the concept of strength with humility. As the Center for Creative Leadership research suggests, vulnerability creates authenticity. Leaders who acknowledge their past mistakes and growth demonstrate this vulnerability while maintaining strength. The BP example illustrates the dangers of self-promotion without corresponding transparency—when the Gulf oil disaster occurred, their "Beyond Petroleum" branding made them an even softer target for criticism.\n\nGenAI tools will likely amplify this dynamic. They can help leaders understand patterns in their own histories while simultaneously making those histories more accessible to others. The maker instinct—the willingness to try, fail, and learn without fear—becomes crucial here. Leaders must approach their past with the same curiosity they apply to future challenges.\n\nIn practice, this might mean leaders developing clearer narratives about their growth journeys while resisting the urge to sanitize their histories. The certification revolution described by Michael Conroy suggests that external validation will become increasingly important, as NGOs and other organizations create new measurement systems for leadership authenticity.\n\nThe futureback mindset offers a useful approach: looking ten years ahead, what relationship with your past will serve you best as a leader? How might you navigate the currents of increased transparency while maintaining the strength that comes from authentic growth?	2025-04-06 20:10:54.249004+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/5f416d36-3e55-490b-a8cc-6277857c9fe5.jpg

As leaders navigate the BANI world—brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible—they will need to design systems that honor both individual freedom and collective wellbeing.\n\nThe most effective leaders will recognize that liberty without shared resources leads to inequality, while collective systems without individual agency become oppressive. GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities to balance these seemingly opposing forces by enabling more nuanced understanding of diverse perspectives.\n\nConsider the Svalbard International Seed Vault near the North Pole. This facility, supported by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and Norwegian government, preserves millions of seed varieties at minus 18 degrees centigrade. It represents a physical commons that protects life's diversity while enabling future innovation and adaptation. Digital commons will increasingly follow this model—preserving knowledge and cultural assets while allowing individuals the liberty to build upon them in novel ways.\n\nThe definition of government as "what we choose to do together" takes on new meaning when GenAI enables more voices to participate in decision-making. Leaders who excel at commons creating will use these tools to find common ground across previously unbridgeable divides, creating clarity of direction while maintaining flexibility of execution.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.'s leadership model offers valuable lessons for this approach. He maintained unwavering clarity about human justice while adapting his tactics to changing circumstances. Similarly, future leaders will need to articulate clear values around both liberty and life while remaining flexive in their implementation strategies.\n\nThe most successful commons will function like clarity filters—separating valuable information from noise while allowing multiple perspectives to contribute. They will establish platforms where competition can occur at higher levels because basic resources are shared.\n\nLeaders who master commons creating will recognize that liberty and life are not opposing forces but complementary values. By designing systems where individual freedom contributes to collective wellbeing, they will help organizations and communities navigate uncertainty while preserving the shared resources on which all depend. The challenge will be maintaining this balance as technology accelerates change and introduces new complexities to our understanding of both liberty and life.	2025-04-06 20:27:41.075823+00	2	f	f

Leaders facing distributed teams and blurred work-life boundaries need capabilities that go beyond personal productivity techniques.\n\nLeaders who apply the maker instinct to time management create personalized systems rather than adopting standardized approaches. These systems incorporate an understanding of human attention patterns and energy cycles—a form of bio-empathy applied to oneself and others. As Dr. Scott Dye's research on proprioception demonstrates, our bodies have internal awareness systems that signal when we're pushing beyond sustainable limits. Similarly, leaders must develop awareness of their optimal working rhythms.\n\nWhen practicing quiet transparency, leaders make their time allocation visible to teams, showing how they prioritize activities that align with organizational purpose. This transparency helps establish norms around time use that respect both individual needs and collective goals.\n\nThe dilemma flipping skill applies directly to time constraints. Rather than seeing time scarcity as a problem to solve through efficiency alone, effective leaders reframe the challenge: "How might limited time focus our attention on what truly matters?" This approach transforms time limitations from obstacles into clarifying forces.\n\nTime management also benefits from rapid prototyping. Leaders can experiment with different approaches to structuring their day, testing what works in short cycles rather than committing to rigid systems that may not suit their actual needs or circumstances.\n\nSmart mob organizing principles extend to how teams coordinate their time. Groups develop shared protocols for when synchronous collaboration is necessary and when asynchronous work is more effective. This represents commons creating—establishing shared agreements about how time is valued within organizations.\n\nProfessor Kentaro Toyama at the University of Michigan found that successful technology implementation requires human qualities of intention, discernment, and self-control. These same qualities apply to time management tools. Without clear intention about how time serves purpose, discernment about which activities deserve attention, and self-control to maintain boundaries, even sophisticated time management technologies will fail to deliver meaningful results.	2025-04-06 20:42:56.357531+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/d0f38ca1-07b5-476c-8a12-6b5a4842d200.jpg

The maker movement has evolved in recent years, shifting from showcasing exotic creations at tech shops to enabling more practical, accessible making in schools and communities. As described in the book, today's Maker Faires in elementary schools focus on children creating things themselves rather than displaying what advanced makers have already produced. This practical evolution suggests a future where artistic creation becomes more embedded in everyday activities.\n\nDr. Scott Dye, an orthopedist mentioned in the book, chose to have his own healthy knee cut open without anesthetic to better understand knee pain. While his colleagues viewed knee problems mechanically, Dye approached them biologically. This experience gave him greater empathy for his patients and a deeper appreciation for the natural design of the human knee. His approach represents a form of bio-engagement that combines scientific inquiry with personal experience.\n\nThe democratization of creative tools is already happening. As noted in the background material, 3D printers have become more powerful and less expensive, while open-source software is more accessible. Generative AI now enables software and hardware coding without requiring deep expertise. These developments point toward a future where more people can engage in creative making.\n\nThe book mentions AI researchers who pioneered curiosity-based models that succeeded by optimizing for novelty rather than explicit objectives. This approach connects to what Alan Kay said at Xerox PARC: "The purpose of research is to fail, but to fail in an interesting way." Organizations that encourage exploration without immediate business outcomes may discover unexpected paths forward.\n\nLooking ahead, leaders might benefit from viewing their organizations through both scientific and artistic lenses. The bio-engagement skill checklist in the book emphasizes observation of nature's patterns, reflection on personal experiences in the natural world, and integration of these patterns with workplace practices. This suggests that future leadership may involve creating environments where rapid prototyping becomes a regular practice and where the boundaries between making, learning, and expressing become less distinct.	2025-04-07 02:54:09.758076+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e1e73ce9-5afa-4f05-910a-1c12428465d7.jpg

The clarity filters that leaders rely upon will be particularly treacherous for women executives navigating environments where their authority is constantly questioned.\n\nIn the BANI world, women leaders confront a paradox: the very AI systems promising to enhance leadership capabilities often encode and amplify historical prejudices. While Ellen Galinsky's understated leadership style demonstrates one successful approach, it also reveals the narrower band of acceptable behavior women must navigate. The quiet transparency that works for some becomes a prison for others, forcing a constant calibration that male counterparts rarely face.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.'s example of clarity with tactical flexibility takes on a more ominous tone when applied to women executives. While Dr. King faced opposition for expanding his focus beyond civil rights to Vietnam and ecology, women leaders encounter resistance for simply asserting their core mission. Their clarity is more frequently mistaken for certainty—that dangerous rigidity that Burton describes as arising from "involuntary brain mechanisms that function independently of reason." AI systems, trained on historical data where women leaders are underrepresented, risk reinforcing this misinterpretation.\n\nThe digital twinning and simulation capabilities that promise to enhance leadership decision-making will create shadow versions of women executives—digital doppelgängers that may be manipulated to undermine their authority. In organizations where "clarity stories evoke trust," women leaders must contend with AI systems that may subtly distort their narratives, transforming clarity into perceived certainty and thus breeding distrust.\n\nThe augmented clarity tools that should democratize access to organizational purpose will instead create new surveillance mechanisms that disproportionately scrutinize women's leadership decisions. The "personal coaching from the CEO in your pocket" becomes a constant evaluation system with shifting standards.\n\nWomen executives must therefore develop a darker vigilance—recognizing that the same AI systems promising to enhance their leadership capabilities may simultaneously be used to constrain them. The future demands women leaders who can navigate this shadow landscape, leveraging augmentation while constantly guarding against its corrupted applications.	2025-04-07 02:55:12.788004+00	2	f	f

This evolution parallels Toyama's framework of intention, discernment, and self-control, but with an added dimension of creative possibility.\n\nCool augmentation will emerge when leaders move beyond the "noisy now" to find that calm place from which they can make choices about GenAI that are both practical and imaginative. Rather than just automating routine tasks, cool augmentation will help leaders flip dilemmas in novel ways, creating solutions that weren't previously visible.\n\nConsider how the futureback mirror might reveal not just what is, but what could be. A leader using cool augmentation might employ GenAI not merely to analyze data faster but to identify patterns that suggest entirely new approaches to bio-engagement or commons creating. The technology becomes not just a tool but a creative partner in leadership.\n\nThis approach requires a shift from what Toyama would recognize as mere intention to what we might call "intentional play" – a willingness to experiment with augmentation in ways that might initially seem impractical but ultimately lead to breakthrough insights. The most effective leaders will balance this experimental approach with discernment, asking not just "Can we?" but "Should we?" and "What unexpected value might emerge?"\n\nCool augmentation will be particularly valuable in depolarizing and commons creating, where conventional approaches often fail. By using GenAI to model complex social dynamics in novel ways, leaders can identify unexpected points of connection and collaboration.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that the allure of cool technology might distract from human-centered leadership. This is where self-control becomes essential – not just as restraint but as mindful direction of technological capabilities toward human flourishing.\n\nAs we move from efficiency and speed toward effectiveness and calm, the coolest augmentations will be those that help us rehumanize leadership rather than mechanize it – tools that enhance our distinctly human capacities for creativity, empathy, and meaning-making in ways we can barely imagine today.	2025-04-07 03:46:32.682373+00	2	f	f

Jenkins, who earned a reputation as "Mr. Green Stadium" through his work with the Seattle Mariners and other teams, demonstrated how environmental consciousness could enhance rather than detract from fan experiences. Following this model, golf course managers are beginning to incorporate natural systems thinking into their operations.\n\nThe concept of time factors significantly in golf's evolution. Just as Jenkins measured energy usage at T-Mobile Park to create feedback systems for conservation, golf facilities can implement similar metrics for water usage, chemical applications, and land management. These measurements create accountability while respecting both ecological boundaries and players' time constraints.\n\nThe emotional connection golfers feel toward their sport—what might be called a form of bio-empathy—can drive sustainable innovation. This mirrors how Jenkins fostered environmental responsibility among stadium staff through real-time feedback and recognition systems. When players develop appreciation for natural settings, they become advocates for preservation practices.\n\nSome courses now maintain native vegetation between fairways, reducing water consumption while creating wildlife corridors. Others have implemented closed-loop water systems that capture rainfall and irrigation runoff for reuse. These approaches align with the bio-engagement principles that Jenkins applied when greening stadiums while improving family experiences.\n\nGolf facility managers who view ecological parameters not as limitations but as design opportunities may discover that working with natural systems produces more distinctive and memorable playing experiences. This approach to dilemma flipping—seeing apparent constraints as creative catalysts—resembles the integrative thinking described by Roger Martin in "The Opposable Mind," where leaders hold two opposing ideas in constructive tension.\n\nBy 2030, golf courses might function as carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots while maintaining their recreational purpose. The leaders who succeed in this space will likely share Jenkins' perspective that "the future is already here—folks just haven't figured it out yet."	2025-04-07 03:47:27.837095+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/bcafefed-6dbb-44b6-8b52-10fa78f92759.jpg

Leaders who successfully partner with these technologies understand that GenAI doesn't simply automate tasks but can extend cognitive processes themselves.\n\nEthan Mollick, in his book "Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI," proposes that humans and AI can form collaborative partnerships where each contributes complementary strengths. This isn't about AI replacing human judgment or merely serving as a subordinate tool, but rather creating a relationship where the combined capabilities exceed what either could accomplish independently.\n\nThis partnership approach requires what Kentaro Toyama identified in his book "Geek Heresy" as the "Three Pillars of Wisdom": intention, discernment, and self-control. These qualities determine whether technology amplifies our best or worst tendencies. Leaders must maintain clear intention about what they're trying to accomplish, discernment about the quality and relevance of AI-generated outputs, and self-control to avoid over-reliance on automated systems.\n\nKenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman's research, detailed in "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned," suggests that the most valuable approach to working with AI involves what they call "novelty search"—exploring possibilities without predetermined objectives. Their work demonstrates that in complex environments, setting rigid goals can actually prevent discovery of the most innovative solutions. Leaders can apply this principle by using AI to explore unexpected connections rather than just solving predefined problems.\n\nEdgar Schein's concept of "Humble Inquiry," described in his book of the same name, takes on new dimensions in the context of AI collaboration. Leaders must develop the ability to ask questions not just of people but of AI systems—learning how to prompt, guide, and refine AI outputs to enhance collective thinking.\n\nAs Jaron Lanier reminds us in his New Yorker article "There Is No A.I.," these systems aren't independent intelligences but complex technological tools. Effective leaders maintain this perspective, working with AI while preserving human agency and ethical responsibility. The distinction is subtle but crucial—viewing AI as a partner in thinking rather than an autonomous thinker changes how we approach the relationship.	2025-04-07 20:27:25.708071+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/2e3ce2a4-36b8-4eca-9875-c538bf8d7bfb.jpg

When Kirshbaum introduced Bob Johansen to generative AI, he demonstrated a specific approach to technology adoption that will become increasingly valuable: the ability to make complex technologies accessible to those with deep domain expertise but limited technical background.\n\nThis form of knowledge exchange creates what we can call "augmented authorship," where human creativity combines with machine capabilities. In practice, this means leaders writing alongside AI systems, with humans providing context, values, and judgment while AI systems offer computational power, pattern recognition, and draft generation. For example, when working with clients at Walmart, Kirshbaum helped executives identify specific business processes where GenAI could augment decision-making without replacing human judgment in customer-facing interactions.\n\nBy 2030, we expect to see the emergence of "bilingual thinkers" in leadership positions—professionals who move comfortably between technical understanding and humanistic concerns. Kirshbaum exemplifies this through his unusual combination of GenAI development skills and poetry appreciation. This combination allows him to both build systems and understand their human implications. At Kellogg, this manifested in developing AI tools that respected the company's brand voice while accelerating content creation across global markets.\n\nThe venture-building aspect of Kirshbaum's work points to a future leadership capability: the ability to construct new organizational forms around AI capabilities. At Deloitte, Kirshbaum helped teams reimagine consulting deliverables by incorporating AI-generated scenarios alongside traditional analysis, creating more comprehensive planning tools for clients facing uncertain futures.\n\nBy 2035, organizations will likely develop formal roles for technology translators who can bridge technical possibilities with organizational needs. These professionals will need to understand both the capabilities of systems like large language models and the specific contexts where they can be most effectively deployed. They will serve as guides for leaders navigating increasingly complex human-machine partnerships, helping to identify which decisions benefit from AI augmentation and which require primarily human judgment and values.	2025-04-07 20:32:40.498691+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/6c3553a9-f19b-4703-8961-1d8c4d154ca9.jpg

Tariff policies exemplify this complexity, requiring leaders to navigate beyond binary thinking.\n\nIn a brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (BANI) future, leaders who approach tariffs as mere problems to solve often rush to action without sufficient foresight. This mirrors the tendency described by Henry Kissinger about American leadership: considering options, reducing them to two choices, selecting one, and running forward at maximum speed. The satisfaction comes from rapid problem-solving rather than dilemma navigation.\n\nInternational trade represents a classic dilemma that can be flipped into opportunity. Just as General Patton viewed military encirclement as an opportunity rather than a hopeless situation when he famously remarked, "They've got us surrounded again, poor bastards," future trade leaders will need to see beyond zero-sum thinking. Where traditional approaches see only protection versus free trade, dilemma flippers will identify multiple pathways and stakeholders.\n\nBy 2035, effective trade policy leadership will require constructive depolarization across increasingly diverse global landscapes. As Thomas Friedman noted, the world is simultaneously flat (interconnected) and jagged (culturally diverse with varying economic pressures). Cross-cultural grace—the ability described by anthropologist Edward T. Hall to listen and learn from people who are different—will become essential when negotiating trade relationships.\n\nFuture trade negotiations will be complicated by what could be called the threshold of righteousness problem. Both protectionists and free traders often operate with absolute certainty in their positions. Leaders will need to maintain clarity (including knowing what they don't know) while avoiding overconfidence in their own positions.\n\nGenerative AI will create new possibilities for dilemma flipping in trade policy by 2030. Leaders will use AI to:\n- Stand in different places, seeing issues from multiple trading partners' perspectives simultaneously\n- Apply lenses from other domains, viewing economic issues through cultural, environmental, and social frameworks\n- Generate powerful questions that explore multiple scenarios beyond binary choices\n- Model complex trade relationships across diverse stakeholders\n\nThe future of international trade leadership will not be about solving tariff "problems" once and for all, but about navigating ongoing dilemmas with grace, clarity without certainty, and the ability to flip challenges into opportunities through multiple perspectives and pathways.	2025-04-07 20:35:43.208026+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/4fc43cf9-941d-4d74-9a0e-19e28a5836ad.jpg

Just as we've seen with leadership, the initial applications of GenAI in legal contexts have primarily focused on efficiency—faster document review, automated case research, and streamlined contract analysis. However, this present-forward view misses the deeper potential for effectiveness that a futureback perspective reveals.\n\nLegal professionals will move beyond simple prompts and answer-finding toward mind-stretching interactions with GenAI. These conversations will help judges and attorneys develop their clarity stories while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties of complex legal questions. Rather than seeking absolute certainty in legal interpretation, which is impossible in a BANI world that is brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible, legal professionals will use GenAI to explore multiple interpretations and implications.\n\nWhat we currently label as "hallucinations" in GenAI systems will become valuable tools for legal meaning-making. When a judge or attorney engages with GenAI to explore novel legal theories or interpretations, these creative extensions beyond established precedent will contribute to more nuanced legal reasoning. As with other domains, these fabrications become useful when properly labeled and incorporated into exploratory exercises.\n\nThe evolution from personal agents to human/agent swarms will be particularly impactful in legal settings. Complex legal cases will benefit from orchestrated collaborations between human legal experts and specialized GenAI agents that can simulate different interpretations and outcomes. Individual attorneys will gain significant power as they leverage these agent systems, though questions of liability will become increasingly complex.\n\nRather than rigid guardrails, legal systems will need bounce ropes—flexible constraints that can adapt as our understanding of GenAI and its implications evolves. The legal profession has always balanced tradition with innovation, and this tension will intensify as GenAI becomes more integrated into jurisprudence.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, augmented jurisprudence may help re-enchant our understanding of justice, moving beyond purely secular control toward a deeper exploration of the moral and philosophical dimensions that underlie legal reasoning. As Arthur C. Clarke noted, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and GenAI may help legal professionals rediscover the deeper mysteries of justice that technical legal analysis sometimes obscures.	2025-04-07 20:52:06.233115+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/53bd19d7-a6f6-4a9e-b182-050de338ef6b.jpg

As the book notes, "Children keep us humble, especially those of us who are parents." This relationship between children and leadership will evolve as GenAI becomes more prevalent in their lives.\n\nThe children growing up today will experience a different relationship with technology than previous generations. The book defines digital natives as "someone who is age 29 or younger in 2025," noting that "whatever media ecology is present at the time a child becomes an adult will influence that person for the rest of their lives." For children growing up with GenAI, this influence will shape their expectations of leadership.\n\nChildren who grow up with augmented leaders around them will likely develop different perspectives on strength and humility. They may come to expect leaders who demonstrate what the book calls "strength with humility" – leaders who are "human and humble—but they have great strength." These children might better understand that vulnerability can coexist with self-confidence.\n\nAccess to technology will likely continue to create disparities. As noted in the book, "If the rich-poor gap continues (it is hard to do a ten-year forecast where it gets better but easy to do one where it gets worse), that will mean that a significant portion of digital natives will be hungry, hopeless, educated, and connected." This suggests that some children will have vastly different experiences with augmented leadership than others.\n\nThe book observes that many of today's young people "are angry about climate disruption and the lack of action by their elders." Children growing up with augmented leadership might expect these tools to address such concerns more effectively, potentially creating new tensions if these expectations aren't met.\n\nAs children observe leaders navigating what the book calls the "BANI future" (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible), they may develop their own approaches to clarity versus certainty. The book notes that "in a BANI future, leaders cannot be certain, but they must have clarity."\n\nChildren might also become more attuned to the difference between automation and augmentation. As they watch leaders make choices about how to use GenAI, they could develop more nuanced views about when technology should replace human tasks versus when it should enhance human capabilities.	2025-04-07 20:54:37.408723+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/7b046a49-672d-4a96-9e69-f3ed86c49fbc.jpg

As generative AI capabilities expand, leaders will face a paradox: the more powerful their augmentation tools become, the more essential it becomes to remain grounded in human values.\n\nThinking futureback from ten years ahead, we can see that the most effective leaders will resist the temptation to pursue technological control for its own sake. Instead, they will use GenAI to amplify human potential and possibilities. This approach aligns with the leadership skill we describe as "strength with humility" – demonstrating powerful capabilities while maintaining a humble recognition of human limitations.\n\nThe danger for leaders lies in what might be called the "Prometheus trap" – believing that technology can provide complete knowledge and control. Leaders who fall into this trap will pursue technological wonders at the expense of human aspirations, creating brittle systems that ultimately fail when confronted with the nonlinear complexities of our increasingly chaotic world.\n\nThe leadership skill of bio-engagement becomes particularly important here. Nature demonstrates that resilience comes not from centralized control but from distributed intelligence and adaptation. Leaders who learn from natural systems will understand that even sophisticated GenAI cannot replace the wisdom embedded in billions of years of evolution.\n\nDigital natives – those who are 29 or younger in 2025 – will have grown up with these technologies as part of their formative experiences. Augmented leaders must help these young people distinguish between valuable technological capabilities and dangerous illusions of technological omnipotence.\n\nThe leadership skill of human calming becomes essential in this context. As researcher Kentaro Toyama suggests in the framework we've adopted, human intention, discernment, and self-control form the foundation for wise leadership. GenAI may offer seemingly godlike capabilities, but only human dreams can provide meaningful direction for those capabilities.\n\nIn a future that is brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (what we call the BANI future), the most successful augmented leaders will use GenAI not to transcend humanity but to help communities articulate and pursue their collective dreams. The true wonder of augmentation lies not in becoming godlike but in helping humanity become more fully itself.	2025-04-07 21:00:16.113976+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/529bdc9b-6ba1-490a-b956-81a4984bcc34.jpg

The construction industry's move toward viewing projects as components of living ecosystems has parallels in accounting, where practitioners are beginning to account for environmental and social impacts that traditional financial reporting overlooks.\n\nJust as Scott Jenkins at the Seattle Mariners stadium implemented feedback systems showing team members their energy usage, accounting firms are developing new metrics and reporting frameworks that make visible previously unmeasured impacts. When Jenkins first asked his staff how much energy it took to run the entire stadium, no one knew—but they quickly developed systems to measure and improve. Similarly, accountants are creating dashboards that track not just financial transactions but also resource usage, waste production, and social impact.\n\nThe Prepare-Foresight-Insight-Action Cycle offers accountants a framework for this evolution. In the Prepare phase, accountants can employ full-spectrum thinking to look beyond traditional financial categories. During Foresight, they can develop scenarios about how accounting might evolve to measure what matters most. The Insight phase transforms these possibilities into practical implications, while the Action phase implements new accounting practices that better reflect organizational impacts.\n\nTransparency in accounting faces challenges similar to those seen with carbon footprints. As detailed in research on product carbon footprints, these calculations depend on numerous assumptions—detergents have different footprints in France than in the United Kingdom due to differences in power generation. The demand for simple measures of complex phenomena creates pressure to reduce nuance, yet oversimplification can be misleading.\n\nAccounting firms could establish commons—shared resources like environmental impact databases or calculation methodologies—that benefit the entire profession while still allowing firms to compete on implementation excellence. This approach mirrors the potential for construction services to create material databases or equipment pools.\n\nLeaders in accounting who demonstrate strength with humility will listen carefully to stakeholders pushing for broader accountability while maintaining the rigor that has always defined the profession. They will take responsibility for the limitations of current accounting practices while working toward more comprehensive approaches.\n\nThe future of accounting lies not in abandoning financial precision but in expanding what gets measured and reported, creating feedback systems that help organizations navigate the complex interplay between financial success and broader impacts.	2025-04-07 23:45:51.115773+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/a2b8e8f4-1556-465c-83bb-4ede79e3ddda.jpg

From a futureback perspective, we can identify several possible scenarios that will require all ten future leadership skills.\n\nIn one potential future, leaders with strong augmented bio-engagement recognize that EVs represent not just a technological substitution but a fundamental reimagining of mobility ecosystems. These leaders might use GenAI to model complex interdependencies between charging infrastructure, grid capacity, battery recycling, and consumer behavior patterns—visualizations that traditional tools cannot produce.\n\nA different pathway emerges when leaders apply the dilemma-flipping skill to seemingly irreconcilable tensions. The environmental benefits of EVs versus the environmental costs of battery production creates a dilemma. Some leaders might use GenAI to identify unexpected solutions that transcend either/or thinking, perhaps discovering new battery chemistries or circular economy approaches that minimize ecological impact.\n\nObservable signals of change already point to smart mob swarming becoming critical for coordinating distributed infrastructure challenges. We see early experiments with human-agent teams combining stakeholders (utility executives, urban planners, consumer advocates) with specialized AI agents that model grid impacts, optimize charging station placement, and simulate adoption patterns.\n\nThe transition reveals limitations in present-forward thinking focused primarily on efficiency and speed. Some leaders approach EVs merely as more efficient transportation, while others adopt a futureback view recognizing that effectiveness and calm are more important than efficiency alone.\n\nHuman calming remains the essential foundation across all scenarios. Leaders must ground themselves in intention (what mobility systems truly serve human needs), discernment (which technologies to deploy when), and self-control (resisting technological solutions without considering human impact).\n\nThe commons creating skill becomes particularly relevant as leaders establish shared charging infrastructure and grid management systems that benefit multiple stakeholders while preventing the tragedy of the commons.\n\nThese multiple pathways demonstrate that augmented leadership isn't about controlling a single future but expanding our capacity to navigate complexity while remaining centered in human values and ecological wisdom.	2025-04-07 21:09:24.010095+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/fb775f14-698f-4cec-93f1-f7c0f89d9640.jpg

The present-forward view of incentives—focused on efficiency metrics, quarterly targets, and individual performance—will prove increasingly brittle in a BANI world where traditional growth patterns become unsustainable.\n\nGenAI will enable leaders to design incentive systems that balance multiple time horizons simultaneously. Rather than choosing between short-term performance and long-term sustainability, augmented leaders will use agent swarms to model complex incentive structures that reward both immediate results and contributions to future organizational resilience. These models will incorporate variables that traditional incentive systems cannot process—ecological impacts, social capital development, and knowledge commons creation.\n\nObservable signals of this shift are already emerging. Some organizations are experimenting with AI-enabled "contribution graphs" that visualize how individual work connects to collective outcomes across multiple time scales. Others are using generative systems to create personalized growth pathways that align individual development with organizational needs while accounting for emerging skills that don't yet exist in formal job descriptions.\n\nThe dilemma-flipping skill becomes essential when confronting the apparent contradiction between growth imperatives and planetary boundaries. Augmented leaders will use GenAI to identify regenerative business models where growth creates rather than depletes commons. This requires moving beyond the efficiency-focused present-forward view toward an effectiveness-oriented futureback perspective.\n\nHuman calming remains the foundation for these new approaches. Leaders must ground incentive decisions in intention (what truly motivates humans beyond financial rewards), discernment (which metrics actually matter), and self-control (resisting the allure of optimization without purpose). Without this human center, AI-augmented incentive systems risk becoming sophisticated manipulation tools rather than genuine growth enablers.\n\nThe commons creating skill will be particularly valuable as leaders design incentives that reward collective intelligence rather than just individual performance. Augmented leaders will establish shared knowledge repositories, collaborative learning environments, and cross-functional innovation spaces where growth emerges from connection rather than competition.\n\nThese new incentive models won't simply measure more efficiently—they'll measure different things entirely, recognizing that in a BANI world, what we choose to incentivize shapes the future we create.	2025-04-07 21:25:35.961623+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/ec7f935e-2529-48f7-b545-53dae769f377.jpg

Today's digital calendars and scheduling assistants primarily focus on filling time slots efficiently, treating a leader's attention as a resource to be allocated rather than a force to be directed with purpose.\n\nOver the next decade, augmented leaders will use GenAI to develop what we might call temporal intelligence—the ability to make qualitatively better decisions about time allocation across multiple horizons simultaneously. This goes beyond efficiency to address effectiveness and calm in a world that is brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible (BANI).\n\nSeveral organizations are already experimenting with systems that visualize how daily activities connect to long-term organizational purpose. For example, one global manufacturing firm has developed an augmented scheduling system that doesn't merely track hours spent but evaluates how different time investments contribute to strategic priorities across one-week, one-quarter, and three-year timeframes.\n\nWhen facing competing demands between urgent tasks and important priorities, augmented leaders will apply the dilemma-flipping skill. Rather than simply choosing between them, GenAI tools will help leaders identify patterns in their attention allocation, revealing hidden biases toward reactivity or excessive planning. Teams of humans and AI agents will work together to simulate how different time allocation strategies might unfold, allowing leaders to see downstream consequences of present choices.\n\nThe foundation for effective time management remains human judgment. Professor Kentaro Toyama at the University of Michigan has developed a framework emphasizing that successful technology use requires human leaders who apply intention (clarity about what truly matters), discernment (wisdom to evaluate which activities create lasting value), and self-control (discipline to resist the allure of constant busyness). Without these human qualities, even the most sophisticated AI scheduling tools become merely more efficient ways to misallocate attention.\n\nAugmented leaders will increasingly create shared understanding of time horizons within their organizations. When team members operate on incompatible temporal scales—some focused on quarterly targets while others consider decade-long implications—friction inevitably results. By establishing common temporal frameworks, leaders can reduce this friction and enable more coherent collective action across different time horizons.\n\nHuman/agent swarms will help leaders maintain this temporal coherence by continuously monitoring alignment between daily activities and long-term vision, suggesting adjustments when misalignment occurs without removing human judgment from the equation.	2025-04-07 21:29:01.796618+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c97f75c0-cd85-4514-8783-87fb8417e332.jpg

While the preceding discussion focused on balancing daily activities with strategic priorities across weeks, quarters, and years, the Anthropocene introduces geological time as a critical dimension for leadership decision-making. This expanded temporal horizon—spanning centuries and millennia—must now be integrated into how augmented leaders allocate attention and resources.\n\nSeveral organizations are adapting their time management approaches to incorporate this extended timeframe. The global manufacturing firm mentioned earlier has added a fourth time horizon to their augmented scheduling system—a "generational impact" view that visualizes how current operational decisions might affect environmental systems over 50-100 year periods. This allows leaders to see connections between today's manufacturing processes and long-term ecological outcomes.\n\nThe bio-engagement skill becomes particularly relevant when managing across these expanded time horizons. GenAI tools are helping leaders visualize complex environmental data across multiple timescales, making abstract long-term consequences more tangible. These tools don't replace human judgment but rather extend a leader's temporal intelligence to encompass timeframes that humans naturally struggle to conceptualize.\n\nWhen facing the dilemma between short-term business imperatives and long-term ecological considerations, augmented leaders apply dilemma-flipping approaches. Rather than treating these as competing priorities, human/agent swarms identify opportunities where addressing long-term environmental concerns can create near-term business advantages. For example, one retail organization uses agent swarms to continuously monitor how sustainability initiatives affect both quarterly financial performance and projected environmental impacts over decades.\n\nThis approach requires enhanced application of Toyama's framework. Leaders must clarify their intention regarding which time horizons truly matter for decision-making. They must exercise discernment in evaluating how different activities create value across multiple timeframes simultaneously. And they must demonstrate self-control to resist focusing exclusively on immediate outcomes when longer-term considerations are equally important.\n\nBy expanding temporal intelligence to encompass Anthropocene timescales, augmented leaders create a shared understanding within their organizations that certain decisions must be evaluated not just against quarterly targets but against their implications for future generations. This doesn't mean ignoring short-term imperatives but rather developing the capacity to hold multiple time horizons in mind simultaneously—a capability that GenAI tools can significantly enhance.	2025-04-07 21:35:08.86882+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/b38f44cc-a226-439d-8948-c1d50270acc5.jpg

They represent not just a technological shift but a fundamental reimagining of mobility systems that requires leaders to apply multiple future leadership skills simultaneously.\n\nWhen approaching electric vehicles, many leaders currently focus on efficiency metrics—battery range, charging speed, and manufacturing costs. This present-forward view, while important, misses the deeper implications visible through futureback thinking. The automotive industry is witnessing signals of change beyond vehicle electrification itself: battery materials companies forming direct partnerships with automakers, energy utilities redesigning rate structures for vehicle charging, and communities rethinking urban design around new mobility patterns.\n\nAugmented bio-engagement—the ability to see challenges from nature's perspective and engage with urgent climate issues—becomes essential when evaluating electric vehicle strategies. Leaders at one European automotive firm have paired engineers with GenAI systems that visualize environmental impacts across the entire vehicle lifecycle. This approach revealed that their initial focus on battery efficiency had overlooked significant opportunities in manufacturing processes and end-of-life recycling.\n\nThe dilemma-flipping skill helps leaders navigate apparent contradictions in the electric vehicle transition. For instance, the tension between immediate profitability and long-term sustainability isn't simply a trade-off to manage but potentially an opportunity to reimagine. Leaders must operate in the space between judging too soon (making premature commitments to specific technologies) and deciding too late (missing market opportunities while competitors advance).\n\nThis approach requires the three human qualities that Professor Kentaro Toyama identified as essential for successful technology implementation: intention (clarifying what outcomes matter most in mobility transformation), discernment (evaluating which electric vehicle strategies create value across multiple timeframes), and self-control (resisting the allure of technological solutions alone when behavioral and systemic changes are equally important).\n\nElectric mobility also demands commons creating—the ability to establish shared assets within which both cooperation and competition can occur. Charging infrastructure represents exactly this type of commons, requiring leaders to orchestrate collaboration among previously disconnected stakeholders while maintaining competitive innovation.\n\nBy approaching electric vehicles through these augmented leadership skills, leaders can move beyond efficiency toward effectiveness—creating mobility systems that serve human needs while addressing climate challenges across multiple time horizons.	2025-04-07 21:40:54.887655+00	1	f	f

While present-forward thinking focuses on vehicle-level metrics, futureback leaders recognize signals of a more profound shift: the emergence of mobility-as-a-commons.\n\nBy 2035, the most successful mobility leaders will have abandoned the traditional ownership model entirely. One surprising signal of this shift comes from an unexpected source—insurance companies are already developing frameworks for fractional vehicle liability that will enable entirely new sharing economies. This represents a dilemma-flipping opportunity where the apparent contradiction between personal mobility freedom and resource efficiency dissolves into new systems of access rather than ownership.\n\nAugmented bio-engagement will extend far beyond carbon accounting to biomimetic design principles. A consortium of Nordic manufacturers has developed GenAI systems that analyze natural mobility systems—from bird migrations to salmon runs—to identify patterns that can inform vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols. Their surprising discovery: introducing controlled randomness into traffic flow systems, similar to how schools of fish move, actually increases overall system efficiency by 23% while reducing collision risks.\n\nThe most audacious leaders are already exploring scenarios where vehicles become mobile energy nodes in distributed power networks. During the Texas grid failures of 2021, some electric vehicle owners used their cars as emergency home power sources. By 2030, this improvised solution could evolve into sophisticated energy commons where vehicles automatically negotiate power sharing based on community needs during extreme weather events—a capability that will become increasingly valuable as climate disruptions intensify.\n\nSmart mob swarming will take unexpected forms as human-agent teams redesign mobility systems. In one scenario, community-level digital twins continuously simulate traffic patterns while citizen-led "mobility councils" make value-based decisions about street usage rights. This represents a radical departure from both centralized planning and market-driven approaches.\n\nThe human calming skill becomes essential as leaders navigate these complex systems. When a major European city implemented an AI-optimized traffic system that prioritized overall efficiency, the resulting patterns felt deeply unsettling to residents despite improved metrics. The most successful implementation came when leaders incorporated what they called "rhythm mapping"—aligning traffic patterns with the natural human rhythms of the community rather than pure efficiency.	2025-04-07 21:42:49.164232+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/e70392d0-e810-4831-b0ef-1b00ff6837be.jpg

As mobility systems evolve toward commons-based models, the experiences of children will serve as both a measure of success and a source of innovation. The relationship between children and these emerging systems will fundamentally shape how the next generation approaches leadership challenges.\n\nThe mobility commons described earlier must account for children's unique needs and perspectives. Current urban design signals point toward this shift—cities like Helsinki and Singapore have begun implementing "child-height audits" of transportation infrastructure, recognizing that mobility systems designed exclusively for adult perspectives create invisible barriers for younger users. These audits reveal how seemingly minor design elements can significantly impact children's autonomy and safety.\n\nBy 2035, the first generation raised with GenAI as an ambient presence will bring different expectations to mobility systems. Unlike today's adults who must consciously adapt to new technologies, these digital natives will intuitively understand the fluid boundaries between physical and digital infrastructure. This represents both opportunity and challenge for leaders developing mobility commons.\n\nThe dilemma-flipping skill becomes particularly relevant when considering children's mobility needs. The apparent contradiction between protecting children and fostering their independence dissolves when systems are designed to provide graduated autonomy—expanding boundaries as children develop the capabilities to navigate them safely. Some European urban planners are already experimenting with "adaptive infrastructure" that responds differently to users based on their experience levels.\n\nLeaders applying bio-engagement principles recognize that children's mobility patterns mirror natural systems in surprising ways. Children naturally create desire paths that often reveal more intuitive routes than those designed by planners. Forward-thinking cities are now incorporating these emergent patterns into formal infrastructure rather than attempting to override them.\n\nThe human calming skill remains essential when designing mobility systems for children. The European city mentioned earlier discovered that children responded differently to AI-optimized traffic patterns than adults did. While adults focused on efficiency metrics, children instinctively evaluated systems based on their rhythmic qualities and predictability. The most successful implementations incorporated these insights, creating what planners called "legible systems"—infrastructure whose patterns could be intuitively understood by users of all ages.\n\nAs mobility commons evolve, children's participation in their design will become increasingly important, not as symbolic stakeholders but as essential contributors with unique perspectives on how these systems should function.	2025-04-07 21:47:12.106334+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/0b281f65-834f-4b09-876c-166d78b9b4ed.jpg

Just as accounting dashboards now track resource usage alongside financial metrics, L&D programs can implement similar visibility into how employees develop and apply new skills.\n\nTechnology companies face a unique challenge: they must prepare their workforce for technologies that don't yet exist. This requires creating what former cavalry soldier and gaming expert Campbell calls "stretching the scenario ten years ahead." Campbell, who despite walking with a limp and missing a finger, demonstrates remarkable ability to navigate multiple realities simultaneously. At the Army War College, he conducts global crisis simulations where he wears a headset to follow gameplay while managing his real-world duties—continuously resetting parameters to stretch players to their limits without overwhelming them.\n\nThis approach translates perfectly to tech company learning environments. By creating safe spaces where employees can practice emerging skills before they're needed in production environments, companies reduce the risk that Bob Johansen's colleague Jake Dunagan articulates: "It is better to be surprised by a simulation than blindsided by reality."\n\nLearning experiences should incorporate real-world immersion similar to Bob's unexpected experience with the industrial cleaning products company. Rather than the anticipated upscale restaurant dinner, Bob found himself cleaning authentically dirty motel rooms with the company's products, trying to meet the 20-minute-per-room standard that regular cleaning staff face daily. This immersion fundamentally changed his understanding of the product's users. Similarly, tech employees might gain invaluable insights by experiencing their products through the eyes of diverse users—perhaps navigating their interfaces using assistive technologies or accessing services via low-bandwidth connections in challenging environments.\n\nJim Spohrer's "WorldBoard" concept—special digital "paper" that can be placed anywhere in physical space and seen only by authorized viewers—offers another model for technology learning environments. Though initially deemed ahead of its time by Steve Jobs in the mid-1990s, this vision of cyberspace overlaying real space will become increasingly practical for creating context-specific learning opportunities throughout tech workplaces.\n\nThe commons approach discussed for accounting firms applies equally to L&D resources. Technology companies could establish shared learning resources while still competing on implementation excellence, creating what Jane McGonigal calls "gameful" experiences that foster urgent optimism and blissful productivity among learners.	2025-04-07 23:48:56.780491+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/21ac9669-2e55-4d98-8265-89e75ca0c577.jpg

GORE-TEX, with its selectively permeable membrane that allows moisture to escape while preventing water from entering, provides a useful metaphor for how children will navigate the boundaries between physical and digital infrastructure in mobility commons.\n\nBy 2035, the same generation of digital natives who intuitively understand GenAI will interact with mobility systems that incorporate GORE-TEX-like principles—allowing certain flows while restricting others. Just as the material creates comfortable microclimates for users in harsh environments, future mobility commons will create safe zones where children can experience graduated autonomy.\n\nThis selective permeability mirrors the dilemma-flipping approach mentioned earlier. The contradiction between protection and independence dissolves when systems, like GORE-TEX, can simultaneously provide both. The European cities experimenting with "adaptive infrastructure" are essentially applying this principle—creating boundaries that respond differently based on user capabilities.\n\nChildren's natural understanding of permeable boundaries will influence how mobility commons evolve. Unlike adults who often see rigid distinctions between physical and digital systems, children perceive these boundaries as fluid. The "legible systems" that European planners discovered children preferred—infrastructure with intuitive, predictable patterns—demonstrate this understanding.\n\nThe human calming skill becomes essential when designing these permeable systems. Leaders must determine which elements should flow freely and which require restrictions, much like how GORE-TEX allows water vapor to escape while blocking liquid water. This discernment requires the intention, self-control, and clarity that Toyama identified as crucial for technology implementation.\n\nBio-engagement principles are evident in how GORE-TEX itself was developed—by observing and mimicking natural systems. Similarly, the most effective mobility commons for children will incorporate their natural movement patterns rather than imposing adult-centric designs. The desire paths that children create, mentioned earlier, represent their intuitive understanding of how permeable systems should function.\n\nAs mobility commons continue to evolve, the selective permeability principle will become increasingly important—allowing children the freedom to explore while maintaining the boundaries necessary for their safety. This balance will be crucial as the first generation raised with ambient GenAI brings their expectations to these systems.	2025-04-07 22:08:18.486805+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/923d754b-d48f-4adf-b0f1-95bdf24ffe5c.jpg

Political organizations will evolve beyond traditional party structures into what might be called "adaptive coalitions" - groups that form around specific issues and reconfigure as needs change, similar to the shape-shifting organizations described earlier.\n\nYoung voters who grew up with GenAI will approach politics differently than previous generations. Having never known a world without AI assistance, they will expect political participation to be more fluid and responsive. These digital natives will move between political affiliations based on specific issues rather than maintaining fixed party loyalties.\n\nPolitical leaders who succeed in this environment will excel at augmented depolarizing. They will use GenAI to identify common values across seemingly opposed groups and create temporary coalitions that address specific concerns. The most effective leaders will apply what Toyama described as intention, discernment, and self-control when determining how to use technology in their political organizing.\n\nBy 2035, we will see political positions that adapt to specific contexts rather than remaining fixed across all issues. This represents a challenge to the current view of politics as a stable spectrum with consistent coalitions.\n\nThere are observable risks in this evolution. Without proper human judgment, political groups could use GenAI to create closed information environments or amplify extreme positions. As noted in the background insights, "hostile mobs often seem more sophisticated in their use of new technologies compared to beneficial smart mobs." This pattern may continue as political organizations adopt GenAI.\n\nYoung digital natives will likely pioneer these new political forms. Their comfort with fluid hierarchies and digital-physical integration will translate into political structures that older generations may find difficult to navigate.\n\nThe smart mob swarms described earlier will become a dominant form of political organization, with GenAI helping to coordinate large groups of people around common purposes. These swarms will be neither fully centralized nor completely decentralized, but will instead feature dynamic leadership that emerges based on context and need.	2025-04-07 22:14:34.603326+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/824e2b05-4690-4881-9a53-af4e1ff86952.jpg

As political structures shift toward adaptive coalitions, public speaking will similarly move beyond the traditional model of a single authoritative voice addressing passive listeners.\n\nPublic speakers in 2035 will regularly employ AI systems that analyze audience engagement across physical and virtual spaces. These systems will detect signals of confusion, disagreement, or enthusiasm, allowing speakers to adapt their presentations in real-time. A corporate CEO might begin a quarterly earnings call with prepared remarks, but AI tools will help them identify which points are resonating with different stakeholder groups, enabling them to emphasize certain aspects for specific audience segments.\n\nThe concept of audience will expand beyond those physically present or watching a livestream. Smart mob swarms will form around speeches and presentations, with participants contributing to the direction and content through digital feedback mechanisms. This mirrors how young voters in 2035 will approach politics - expecting fluid, responsive participation rather than fixed hierarchies.\n\nAI translation and contextual systems will allow speakers to simultaneously reach diverse audiences. A community organizer in Chicago might deliver remarks that are automatically adapted for different cultural contexts while preserving the core message, similar to how the Patient-Led Research Collaborative coordinated thousands of volunteers with different backgrounds to conduct research on long COVID.\n\nBy 2035, many speakers will work with AI systems that suggest adjustments to content and delivery based on audience response patterns. The most effective communicators will develop clear frameworks for when to follow these suggestions and when to rely on human judgment. This reflects the broader leadership challenge of balancing agent autonomy with ethics and control.\n\nYoung digital natives who grew up with GenAI will approach public speaking differently than previous generations. Having experienced education and social interaction with AI assistance, they will naturally integrate these tools into their communication styles, much as they navigate between political affiliations based on specific issues rather than maintaining fixed loyalties.\n\nThe risks in this evolution include potential overreliance on AI suggestions, creating homogenized rhetoric that lacks authentic human voice. As with political organizing, there's also potential for creating closed information environments where speakers and audiences reinforce existing beliefs rather than engaging with diverse perspectives.	2025-04-07 22:16:32.349582+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/54560443-a977-49f1-bcd6-5230891169f9.jpg

Just as Butterflies AI created a social platform where AI characters interact with humans for hours daily, public speaking will evolve into a dynamic exchange between human speakers, AI systems, and audience members across physical and digital spaces.\n\nPublic speaking will become a form of augmented smart mob swarming. Like the innovation consultants who first encountered GPT-2 and realized their core value proposition was changing, professional speakers will discover that their value lies not in delivering prepared content but in orchestrating meaningful exchanges. The limiting factor will be the speaker's own ability to understand what "good" looks like in this new context.\n\nSpeakers who embrace the futureback view will focus on effectiveness rather than efficiency. Rather than using AI to simply deliver speeches faster or with fewer errors, they will leverage technology to create more meaningful connections. This mirrors the shift from efficiency and speed to effectiveness and calm described in Table 3.\n\nBy 2035, public speakers will regularly work with agent systems that function like bounce ropes rather than guardrails. These systems won't simply prevent speakers from making mistakes but will create flexible boundaries that allow for improvisation while maintaining coherence. A corporate leader might begin with a clarity story but allow the presentation to evolve based on real-time feedback from both human and AI participants.\n\nDigital natives who grew up with GenAI will approach public speaking differently than previous generations. Having experienced education with AI assistance, they will naturally integrate these tools into their communication styles. However, as with farming and tractors, the technology will only amplify existing skills—it won't turn a poor communicator into a compelling one.\n\nThe most effective public speakers will balance mind-stretching interactions with meaning-making. Rather than simply avoiding AI "hallucinations," they will use these creative outputs to generate new insights and perspectives, much as leaders must do when navigating the BANI future that is brittle, anxious, nonlinear, and incomprehensible.	2025-04-07 22:19:46.319049+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/74b46f07-4bf9-4d8c-bf4c-e2c157651f3c.jpg

Just as tech firms create simulations to practice emerging skills, restaurants can develop environments where staff experience different aspects of service before encountering them in high-stakes situations with actual guests.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory, with its notably extensive menu of over 250 items and complex operational requirements, presents a perfect case for applying these principles. The challenge of maintaining consistent quality across locations while managing high-volume service parallels the technology sector's need to prepare for unknown futures. Campbell's approach of "stretching the scenario ten years ahead" can be adapted to restaurant training by creating simulations that anticipate evolving customer expectations and service challenges.\n\nImmersive learning at The Cheesecake Factory might involve having kitchen staff spend time dining as customers with specific dietary restrictions. This mirrors the industrial cleaning products company exercise where executives, including Bob, cleaned actual motel rooms with their products under the same 20-minute time constraint faced by regular cleaning staff. That experience fundamentally changed their understanding of their products and users. Similarly, having chefs experience the anxiety of communicating allergies or waiting for modified orders creates empathy that transforms kitchen operations.\n\nThe restaurant could implement what Jane McGonigal calls "real-play" scenarios—where staff play themselves in unusual settings—rather than traditional role-playing. These gameful experiences foster what McGonigal identifies as "superpowers": urgent optimism (the belief that success is possible), social fabric (strengthened connections), blissful productivity (satisfaction from meaningful work), and epic meaning (connection to something larger than oneself).\n\nDigital technologies could create learning opportunities throughout the restaurant environment. Jim Spohrer's "WorldBoard" concept—digital information overlaid on physical spaces visible only to authorized viewers—could manifest as AR displays showing optimal plate arrangements during training or highlighting potential safety hazards during kitchen walkthroughs.\n\nThe commons approach discussed for accounting and technology firms applies equally to restaurant training. The Cheesecake Factory could participate in industry-wide sharing of basic food safety protocols while focusing internal training resources on distinctive competencies like executing their complex menu or delivering their signature guest experience.\n\nBy creating these low-risk environments to practice high-stakes interactions, The Cheesecake Factory would embody Jake Dunagan's wisdom that "it is better to be surprised by a simulation than blindsided by reality"—preparing staff for the unexpected challenges of restaurant service before they impact actual guest experiences.	2025-04-07 23:51:02.136633+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/c37ebe9a-055d-48f7-a341-0987369ae9dd.jpg

City governments will need to balance technological capabilities with human needs in increasingly complex urban environments.\n\nLeaders in municipal services who adopt futureback thinking will recognize that simply digitizing existing processes is insufficient. Instead, they will create responsive systems where humans and AI collaborate to address community needs. This shift parallels the broader movement from efficiency-focused approaches to effectiveness-centered solutions described in the leadership framework.\n\nThe most effective municipal systems will operate as networks connecting citizens, civil servants, and AI systems in coordinated responses. When a resident reports an infrastructure issue, the system might coordinate multiple departments simultaneously rather than following linear processes. This represents a practical application of smart mob swarming principles in the public sector.\n\nThese municipal systems will require the flexibility of bounce ropes rather than rigid guardrails. During unexpected situations like service disruptions or emergency responses, protocols must adapt while maintaining essential functions. This flexibility will be particularly valuable as cities face increasingly unpredictable challenges.\n\nMunicipal leaders will also engage in meaning-making with their technological systems. An AI suggestion that initially seems unusual might actually represent a creative approach to urban challenges. Leaders who can distinguish between genuine errors and innovative thinking will gain advantage in addressing complex problems.\n\nThe public sector will serve as an important testing ground for the balance between human judgment and computational assistance. As with the innovation consultants who first encountered early language models, municipal leaders will discover that technology amplifies their capabilities but doesn't replace the need for human discernment.\n\nThe limiting factor in these augmented municipal services won't be the technology itself but rather the leaders' ability to envision what "good" looks like in this new context. Those who develop clarity about their desired outcomes while remaining open to multiple pathways will be most successful in creating public services that truly serve their communities.	2025-04-07 22:21:10.362154+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/de9489d0-6990-42e7-ad7c-619285d0f63a.jpg

While city governments are developing responsive networks connecting citizens and AI, agricultural operations are undergoing similar transformations in how they manage land, resources, and production.\n\nThe agricultural sector provides a compelling example of augmentation principles in action. In 2019, innovation consultant Jeremy encountered GPT-2 while conducting forecasting work with IFTF and realized that computers were beginning to perform idea generation—the core of his professional value. This experience led him to compare himself to "an old farmer digging with a shovel until someone showed him the first tractor." This agricultural metaphor is particularly apt, as farming itself is experiencing comparable technological disruption.\n\nBy 2035, agricultural leaders will distinguish themselves by how they integrate technology with ecological understanding. Observable signals of this change are already emerging in experimental farms that combine sensor networks with regenerative practices. These operations demonstrate that effectiveness comes not just from doing things faster but from doing fundamentally better things for soil health and ecosystem resilience.\n\nAgricultural operations will increasingly function as human-agent swarms rather than hierarchical organizations. When weather patterns shift unexpectedly, these systems will coordinate responses across equipment, field workers, and management—similar to how municipal systems will coordinate multiple departments simultaneously during infrastructure issues.\n\nThe bounce rope concept applies equally to agriculture, where rigid protocols must give way to adaptive responses. During drought conditions or disease outbreaks, agricultural systems will need to maintain core functions while adapting to changing circumstances—just as municipal services must during emergencies.\n\nAgricultural leaders, like their municipal counterparts, will engage in meaning-making with their technological systems. When an AI suggests an unusual planting pattern or resource allocation, discerning leaders will evaluate whether this represents an error or an innovative approach to complex ecological challenges.\n\nThe success of these augmented agricultural systems will ultimately depend on leaders who understand both traditional farming wisdom and emerging technological capabilities—those who can articulate what "good" agricultural outcomes look like in an increasingly complex environment.	2025-04-07 22:22:48.011537+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/3a453dec-9c16-426f-a46d-8d95814d85ec.jpg

Consider how musical groups navigate similar territory between tradition and innovation. Fleetwood Mac, with their evolving lineup and creative processes, exemplifies patterns that future augmented leadership will follow across sectors.\n\nAgricultural leaders adapting to technological change share commonalities with how musical collaborations evolve. Just as farmers must understand both soil science and sensor networks, successful musical groups balance artistic intuition with technical capabilities. The farmer who knows when to trust the tractor's efficiency and when to rely on personal judgment mirrors the musician who integrates new production technologies while maintaining creative vision.\n\nBy 2035, both agricultural operations and creative collaborations will function as human-agent swarms rather than rigid hierarchies. When unexpected challenges arise—whether weather patterns affecting crops or market shifts impacting creative industries—these systems will coordinate adaptive responses across human and technological participants. The fluidity of these arrangements will require leaders who can maintain coherence despite changing conditions and participants.\n\nThe bounce rope concept applies equally in both contexts. During drought conditions or creative blocks, systems must maintain core functions while adapting to changing circumstances. Rigid protocols give way to responsive frameworks that preserve essential operations while allowing for innovation and experimentation.\n\nAgricultural and creative leaders alike will engage in meaning-making with their technological systems. When an AI suggests an unusual resource allocation or creative direction, discerning leaders will evaluate whether this represents error or innovation—distinguishing between hallucination and valuable insight.\n\nThe success of these augmented systems ultimately depends on leaders who understand both traditional wisdom and emerging capabilities in their respective domains—those who can articulate what "good" outcomes look like in increasingly complex environments.

Just as farmers must decide when to trust automated systems versus personal judgment, procurement leaders will navigate similar territory when evaluating potential partners. The bounce rope concept we discussed becomes particularly relevant when organizations must maintain vendor relationships through market volatility while adapting to changing circumstances.\n\nBy 2030, vendor selection will evolve beyond traditional RFP processes toward what we might call "commons-based procurement ecosystems." These ecosystems will draw inspiration from companies like Hugging Face, which hosts open-source AI models that anyone can freely access and use. Despite its playful name, Hugging Face has built a serious business valued at $4.5 billion in 2023 by offering optional specialized computing infrastructure while making their core resources available to all. They've demonstrated how giving away valuable resources can create more value than hoarding them.\n\nEnterprise procurement will increasingly evaluate vendors not just on proprietary offerings but on their contributions to shared resources and participation in reciprocity-based innovation. This mirrors how musical collaborations evaluate new members based on both technical skill and collaborative potential.\n\nThe maker instinct will manifest in procurement through rapid prototyping approaches. Rather than lengthy evaluation cycles, enterprises will engage vendors in short co-creation sprints where solutions are quickly tested and refined. This approach resembles how agricultural innovators might test new techniques on small plots before full implementation.\n\nDiasporas—communities with strong shared values—will form around industry-specific commons like shared data repositories or testing environments. These commons will allow vendors to demonstrate capabilities in realistic scenarios rather than controlled demonstrations.\n\nCuriosity-driven procurement will favor vendors who embrace field-based learning over those promising perfect solutions through advance planning. The most valued partners will be those who can pivot alongside their enterprise clients, much like musicians who can improvise when performances take unexpected turns.\n\nIn this environment, vendor selection becomes less about choosing isolated providers and more about curating a network of potential collaborators who can help create new commons that benefit multiple parties simultaneously. The discernment required mirrors the judgment needed when deciding which agricultural technologies to adopt or which musical innovations to incorporate.	2025-04-07 23:24:10.535951+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/00ddf027-bbe9-4408-bf06-861707485372.jpg

This cost reduction follows a pattern similar to Moore's Law in computing—what once cost billions now costs thousands, and by 2034, personal genome sequencing will likely become as commonplace as blood tests.\n\nThis accessibility creates interesting parallels to the vendor selection ecosystems discussed earlier. Just as procurement leaders must evaluate when to trust automated systems versus personal judgment, healthcare organizations will need to determine when genomic data should inform decisions and when human expertise should prevail. The bounce rope concept applies equally well here—maintaining relationships with genomic technology providers while adapting to rapidly changing capabilities.\n\nBy 2030, genomic information will become part of what we might consider a biological commons. The Svalbard International Seed Vault provides an instructive example of commons creating in the biological realm. Built into a mountain near the North Pole, this facility preserves crop diversity for future generations. In 2024, it received its largest batch of seed deposits since opening, including diverse crops such as beans, barley, maize, and rice. With storage capacity for up to 45 million seed varieties preserved at minus 18 degrees centigrade, it represents a physical biological commons.\n\nDigital genomic commons will emerge alongside these physical repositories. Organizations like the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health are already establishing frameworks for sharing genomic data while respecting privacy and ownership concerns. These commons will allow multiple parties to benefit from shared assets while still competing at higher levels.\n\nThe maker instinct will manifest through rapid prototyping of personalized treatments based on genomic information. Rather than lengthy clinical trials for broad populations, healthcare providers will engage in targeted interventions based on specific genetic profiles.\n\nDiasporas will form around specific genetic conditions, with patient communities contributing data to accelerate research while maintaining control over how their information is used. This represents a shift from passive patients to active participants in the research process.\n\nLeaders who develop bio-empathy—understanding biological processes and cycles—will navigate this landscape more effectively than those who approach genomics mechanistically. The most successful will be those who can see beyond competitive advantages to create commons that benefit entire industries and communities.	2025-04-07 23:26:01.022321+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/323e34e2-fbd9-4c80-ad9e-d86be5cf1db1.jpg

Just as organizations are establishing frameworks for sharing genomic data while respecting privacy concerns, forward-thinking businesses can apply similar principles to create value through collaborative platforms.\n\nVirj Kan's Primitives Biodesign exemplifies this approach. Her company transforms destructive purple sea urchins into valuable biomaterials for tiles and furniture. This creates economic incentives that simultaneously restore kelp forests and generate profit. Rather than viewing environmental challenges as constraints, Kan recognizes them as opportunities for innovation and value creation.\n\nYou might consider what ecological systems intersect with your business operations. The Salatin family's Polyface Farm demonstrates how principles of transparency, grass-based agriculture, respect for animal individuality, mimicking natural patterns, and prioritizing soil health can create a thriving multi-generational enterprise. They've lowered costs by reducing purchased inputs while producing healthier products that command premium prices.\n\nGenerative AI tools can help you model your business as an ecosystem similar to how genomic data is being analyzed. These tools can simulate complex, interconnected systems and identify potential intervention points where small changes might produce significant results. This capability parallels how healthcare organizations are learning to determine when genomic data should inform decisions versus when human expertise should prevail.\n\nBy 2034, as biological principles become integrated into more industries, businesses that contribute to biological commons may gain competitive advantages. The bounce rope concept applies here too—maintaining relationships with biological technology providers while adapting to rapidly changing capabilities.\n\nConsider what your business might contribute to a shared asset that benefits your industry. Could you establish data-sharing protocols similar to those being developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health? Might you create physical repositories of biological materials like the Svalbard Seed Vault, but specific to your sector?\n\nThe maker instinct will drive rapid prototyping of bio-engaged business models. Patient communities forming around specific genetic conditions offer a template for how businesses might engage with specialized customer segments—creating value through participation rather than passive consumption.	2025-04-07 23:36:08.951873+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/bc1890e0-09ae-4b55-9fa6-2e168613f906.jpg

As businesses adapt to changing regulations, they must approach plastics not as isolated products but as elements within broader ecological systems.\n\nThe maker instinct that drives rapid prototyping in digital innovation is increasingly being applied to materials science. Just as Bob and Jeremy developed ForesightCoach through iterative experimentation—starting with a simple "Talk to Office Shock" demo that evolved into a sophisticated interactive system—materials scientists are creating new generations of plastics through similar processes of experimentation and feedback. These scientists begin with real user needs and environmental constraints, then develop solutions through cycles of trying, learning, and trying again.\n\nVirj Kan's approach to sea urchin biomaterials offers a template for plastics innovation. Rather than viewing environmental problems as obstacles, Kan recognized that creating economically valuable products from destructive purple sea urchins could incentivize their removal and help restore kelp forests. Similarly, companies might develop valuable applications for plastic waste, creating economic incentives for collection and processing.\n\nThe Salatin family's principles at Polyface Farm provide a framework for rethinking plastics production. Their commitment to transparency—"no trade secrets, no locked doors, every corner is camera-accessible"—could transform how plastics manufacturers operate. Their focus on "mimicking natural patterns on a commercial domestic scale" suggests plastics designed to fit within, rather than disrupt, natural cycles.\n\nScott Jenkins' work greening sports stadiums demonstrates how feedback systems can drive behavioral change. Just as Jenkins implemented systems showing team members their energy usage and rewarded conservation, plastics manufacturers might develop tools that give consumers and producers visibility into material flows and environmental impacts.\n\nBy applying the bio-engagement skill checklist to plastics—being observant of nature's patterns, reflecting on experiences, integrating natural patterns with workplace practices, learning from ecosystem resilience, practicing mindfulness, looking to nature for innovative ideas, and maintaining a sense of long-term responsibility—leaders can transform constraints into opportunities for innovation.\n\nThe genomic commons model suggests possibilities for collaborative approaches to plastics innovation, where companies might share certain fundamental research while competing on implementation and customer experience, similar to how healthcare organizations are navigating the balance between shared genomic data and proprietary applications.	2025-04-07 23:37:44.655157+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/bf545420-448d-46ea-bc9f-7551c51713ca.jpg

Construction companies are beginning to view their projects not as isolated structures but as components of living ecosystems that must work in harmony with natural systems.\n\nThe Eastgate Centre in Harare, Zimbabwe offers a practical example of bio-engagement in construction. This building uses airflow principles observed in termite mounds to regulate temperature without conventional heating or air-conditioning. The architects studied how termites maintain constant temperatures in their mounds despite external temperature fluctuations, then applied these principles to create a building that stays cool using significantly less energy than conventional structures.\n\nIn sports stadiums, Scott Jenkins—who served as vice president of ballpark operations for the Seattle Mariners—implemented feedback systems that showed team members their energy usage and rewarded conservation efforts. Construction services can adopt similar approaches, providing real-time data on material usage, waste production, and energy consumption to project teams. This feedback, combined with incentive systems, can drive more sustainable practices throughout the construction process.\n\nThe transparency principles practiced at Polyface Farm—"no trade secrets, no locked doors, every corner is camera-accessible"—offer a model for construction services to increase accountability and knowledge sharing. Open-source building techniques and transparent supply chains could become standard practice, allowing innovations to spread more rapidly across the industry.\n\nConstruction services are well-positioned to create new commons—shared assets that benefit multiple players. These might include material databases documenting the environmental impact of different building materials, shared equipment pools that increase utilization rates of expensive machinery, or collaborative research initiatives focused on bio-based building materials.\n\nLeaders in construction services who practice commons creating will look beyond competing for market share to growing the overall market for sustainable building. They will recognize that by sharing certain knowledge and resources, they can compete at a higher level—focusing on implementation excellence rather than proprietary techniques.\n\nAs with the Svalbard International Seed Vault, which preserves crop diversity for future generations, construction commons could preserve building techniques and material knowledge that might otherwise be lost, creating platforms for future innovation while honoring traditional wisdom.	2025-04-07 23:43:50.796432+00	1	f	f	https://twneftabwsebtktuyyni.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/images/0d86033c-e8c4-4130-9bc7-5c5a2e39f475.jpg
